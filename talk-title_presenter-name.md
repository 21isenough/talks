Speaker Bio

Hi.

**About me:**
Maybe you haven't heard of me, but I am [Time Magazine's 2006 person of the year](https://www.adherecreative.com/hs-fs/hubfs/time-you.jpg?width=570&height=760&name=time-you.jpg). It's a lot fo responsability, but such is a (Rockstar|Unicorn|Code Ninja)'s life.

**About what I do:**
I'm an avid supporter of the open source community, meaning that I often use open source content in my projects and, in return do them the courtesy of not introducing bugs of my own. I'm a fullstack cross-platform developer, meaning that I can add ~~bugs~~ features just about anywhere in your codebase without much sweat. I've ~~crashed~~ built and ~~obfuscated~~ maintained Android, iOS and Rails web apps over the course of roughly 5 years of ~~paid~~ professional endeavours and my motto is `Quidquid latine dictum sit, altum videtur`.
