Demystifying Binary Reverse Engineering
========================

* Speaker   : Andr√© Baptista
* Length    : ~40 mins
* Language  : English/Portuguese

Description
-----------

Reverse engineering is not just about uncovering the hidden behaviour of a given technology, system, program or device. It's actually an art and a mindset.
Reversing is used by some government agencies, secret services, antivirus software companies, hackers and students. It can be used for many purposes: cracking/bypassing software, botnet analysis, finding 0day exploits, interpreting unknown protocols, understanding malware or finding bugs in apps.

In this talk, after a brief introduction, I'm going to show you:

* Reversing tools and how to use them
* How to perform static and dynamic analysis
* Side channel attacks
* How to use the [Z3 Theorem Prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) to solve systems of equations
* Control-flow analysis via symbolic execution (used in [DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge](https://cgc.darpa.mil))
* Demos - *Bring your laptop!*
* The future of reverse engineering

Yo! I live in Coimbra, Portugal, where I was born in 1994. I started programming when I was 12 and using Linux when I was 15. Since then, I started developing random projects and doing some personal research about Computer Science. When I was in the high school I spent a lot of time exploring the world of Information Security. Then, I went to the University of Coimbra, where I finished my BSc in Computer Science in 2015.

I just completed the first year of my MSc in Information Security in the University of Porto. I've always loved Infosec and online security challenges are my supper. In April 2015 I joined xSTF, a CTF team from the University of Porto. Since then, we've been spending weekends in the University pwning stuff and drinking beers.

Currently, I am a researcher in INESC TEC, working with some badass algorithms, and I also contribute to [C3P](http://c3p.up.pt) (Center of Competence in Cyber Security and Privacy) in the University of Porto.
