The Future of Ethereum UX

Description
-----------

The Ethereum user experience is still far from the one user's have gotten used to with the web 2.0. Browser wallets in the form of browser extensions have become the de facto way users interact with dapps. This mechanism demands too much from the user, as users are forced to 1) have Ether in their accounts and 2) have to manually sign and approve transactions. 

In this talk, we will be presenting two tools that when combined, provide users with the same user experience they have interacting with traditional web apps. The first is Shipl, a framework which enables dapp developers to pay for the gas costs of their users, thus, removing the need for users to hold any Ether in their wallets. It is a meta transaction SAAS. The second is the Identity Manager, an in-browser application (not extension) which provides a secure decentralized way to manage decentralized identities (DIDs) and keys inside the browser.

This will be a somewhat technical talk, with a live demo, where we will explore the mechanisms behind Ethereum meta-transactions and decentralized identity.
It is targeted at dapp developers, with a stronger focus on backend architecture.

My name is João Santos and I am a full stack developer at [Shipl](https://shipl.co), a ConsenSys spoke. I got my MSc in Computer Science at Instituto Superior Técnico, my thesis was DClaims, a decentralized censorship resistant framework for web annotations, built on top of Ethereum and IPFS. I joined Consensys in mid-2018 working on advisory research spoke called [Helena](https://helena.network) where I mostly worked on writing Solidity smart-contracts. Recently I joined Shipl, where I focus mostly on the backend. I have also collaborated with the IPFS team developing the [Identity Manager RFC](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star/blob/16d50bf50e7bd1ce89f0fe0195e2b522a703766f/docs/rfc-identity.md) and with the [Rebooting the Web of Trust community](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo).
