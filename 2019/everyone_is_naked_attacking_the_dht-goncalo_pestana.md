Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are an important primitive which allow multiple
nodes to collaboratively store and retrieve data in a completely decentralised
network. Nowadays, millions of users are using services which rely on DHTs:
Bittorrent, IPFS, Freenet, Ethereum are just examples of projects leveraging
DHTs to store and retrieve data in a decentralised way. With the upcoming Web
3.0, it is expected that DHTs will become an even more important building block.

Naive implementations of DHTs leak critical information about user behaviour
e.g. who is storing and retrieving specific files in the network. It is often
trivial for adversaries to collect data that can be correlated to understand
what network users are up to. The data leaked can used for mass surveillance,
censorship and privacy attacks on DHT users.

In this talk, we first dive into what are DHTs, how they work and its privacy
vulnerabilities. After motivating the reasons of why anonymous and private
systems are important for the future the internet and society, we'll perform a
live privacy attack on a public DHT. We will see how easy it is to collect and
correlate public activity in DHTs and generate usage profiles that can be used
against DHT users.

We will also go through some techniques and protocols used to harden privacy in
DHTs based on current research and applications such as onion routing,
friend-to-friend routing, and others.
