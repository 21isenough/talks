========================

Description
-----------

Sometimes I wonder how can I love Javascript when all of a sudden it stops knowing what 'this' is. And have you ever tried to implement class inheritance with the Internet off? All of these impossible tasks are now a lot easier (and readable) with ECMAScript 2015 (aka ES6).

My aim is to present you my favourite parts and show you how to easily fall back in love with JS.
