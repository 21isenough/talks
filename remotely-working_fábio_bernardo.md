Remotely Working
========================

* Speaker   : FÃ¡bio Bernardo
* Available : Any
* Length    : 30 mins
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

Two years ago I started working for a **100% remote development agency**. We work with industry giants and we're all around the world. This talk is about sharing the journey from being doubtful it would ever work to a remote working evangelist.

####Questions I will answer:

* How do you deal with seemly impossible time zones?
* Don't clients require you to have meetings at 03:00 AM?
* Is your team reliable?
* Isn't working in an office more inspiring? Don't you learn more?
* Anyone can work remotely?
* What lessons did you learn during your experience that can be applied to other companies both local and remote?

####The talk length:

I think **20 minutes of talking** and **10 minutes of Q&A** is the best format for this topic.
