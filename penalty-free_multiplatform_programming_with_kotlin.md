In a time where native platform support can be a significant advantage, having a toolchain that enables free or practically free abstractions is groundbreaking. It allows individuals and small teams to effectively compete with large corporations.

LLVM opened a door, and Rust, Swift & Co came in. Kotlin, adding seamless JVM / JS support and interop on top of this, is the ultimate contender in true, penalty-free multiplatform programming.

In this talk, we'll go over the core ideas behind Kotlin Multiplatform, how it works, how it integrates with different platforms, its strenghts, weaknesses, and how it looks like in a real-world scenario.

It's daunting to even consider launching a native app for Web, Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and providing a backend for all that. But what if you could share most of the code? This could be revolutionary, specially for indie developers.

Rust, Swift and other LLVM-based languages can arguably provide this, but not without downsides. For one, using native libraries on Android is a little cumbersome and incurs in call site penalties. On the other hand, WebAssembly support has come a long way, but still sits at roughly 78%. Good, but not best.

Ultimately, Kotlin Multiplatform is the most interesting and ambitious thing about Kotlin. It raises the bar on penalty-free, multi-platform development. It allows small teams to compete with large enterprises (that will undoubtedly take a long time to adopt this) on all fronts that matter.

Lastly, it is backed by JetBrains, and consequently surrounded by incredible tooling.
