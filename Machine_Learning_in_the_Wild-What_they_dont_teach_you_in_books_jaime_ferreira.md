Machine Learning in the Wild - What they don't teach you in books
========================

* Speaker   : [*Pedro Bizarro*]
* Available : [*Any Date*]
* Length    : [*30-45 minutes*]
* Language  : [*English*]

Description
-----------

In this talk you will learn why Machine Learning and Data Science are much more than algorithms. Out there, in real world industrial applications, it is a complex and intertwined mix of technology, domain constraints, intuition and team-work. Using real stories from Feedzai's experience fighting fraud in payments, we will illustrate why applying machine learning to live systems goes beyond using a dataset to train a predictive model. Technological issues such as scale, class balancing, concept drift, and data cleaning are a challenge to any data scientist, but they are only part of the story. In this talk, we will also show how non-technological issues can be so hard, and why good practices can have a tremendous impact on results.
