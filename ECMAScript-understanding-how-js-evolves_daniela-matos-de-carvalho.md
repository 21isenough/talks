ECMAScript: Understanding how JS evolves
========================

* Speaker   : Daniela Matos de Carvalho
* Available : Anytime
* Length    : 30-40min
* Language  : English

Description
-----------
We already use most of the features in ES6, but do we know whatâ€™s coming next?

This talk will drive you to understanding ECMAScript and how a feature goes from one stage to another: we will take a look into what features are coming next in JavaScript, and how can we test those using transpilers such as Babel.

We will also try to understand what are the main influencers for new feature proposals and how both back-end (Node.js) and front-end influences that.
