X challenges of creating a hardware product and how to overcome them (or not)
========================

* Speaker   : João Carreiro
* Length    : 30 mins
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

Our world is made of things that we can touch, and while those things keep getting smarter and full of code, the physical object that makes the code real is still the focus of a lot of our attention.

Building hardware is hard, building something we can call a product and not only an object is even harder.

In this talk I'll try to touch a bit on the importance of UX in hardware products but mostly talk about the most common road blocks I see people hitting and (maybe) how they can go around them.

At 16 I created the 1st online radio in Portugal. It mainly streamed live online games and quickly went from uncapping coaxial modems to a sponsorship from the national telecom operator.

I started my first company at 18 and went from IT to be the main supplier of criminal investigation equipment in Portugal.

In 2011 I became the youngest Sales Responsible for a company working in homeland security and soon after that, my startup developed and launched the world smallest 4G HD video server.
