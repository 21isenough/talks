Description
-----------

We are all on the business of distributed computing no matter if you are a back-end or a front-end developer and this is a hard problem to solve.

This talk is about how we can use LISP, in this case Clojure/ClojureScript, to address our web development problems and avoid some incidental complexity.

#### WTF

Clojure is a Lisp for the JVM, built around multi-core and concurrent programming, and it's doing pretty well for the niche that it fits. However, the JVM doesn't run everywhere. I remember back in the day, when SUN talked about Java, there was this fantasy that Java would run in the server and in the client solving all the Internet problems. It kinda didn't work that way.

Javascript.... Javascript is really the language of clients, some even call it the assembly language of the web, it is everywhere and everything compiles into javascript this days. So does ClojureScript also, a Lisp that compiles to Javascript bringing the Clojure toolset and simplicity to the client-side world.

#### The plan

I attended Codebits 2008 and saw Mario Valente's proposal to use Javascript everywhere and conquer the world by 2015. In 2016 I'll try to do the same but this time with one of the most old, powerful and misunderstood languages of all time, I'll like to call it `the revenge of LISP`.

We will dig into what it brings into the table and how we can use this language and it's toolset to approach our day to day web development problems.

The idea is to have 15 mins where I'll sell and talk about why this is a kickass stack aka flamewar!, 15 mins showing some code and demos aka fail badly, 10 mins for questions aka you guys trying to refute me :slightly_smiling_face:

So bring your laptops and don't be afraid of some (parenthesis (ftw!))
