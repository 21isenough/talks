If you have been developing rich web applications for some time, you probably love [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) by now. This talk aims to provide a brief introduction to React and [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) and jump right away into a production use case, where things aren’t as simple as the examples you get from tutorials!

Using React to build encapsulated UI components is just the tip of the iceberg.

For two years now, I've been developing a large size Web application at Doist, where we juggle around with React, as well as data fetching, error handling, and local data management, all while providing a smooth and predictable user experience where the user is confident about their actions whether they succeed or fail.

In the first part, we'll dive into the basic concepts of the React framework and the Flux unidirectional data flow architecture.

Based on these two concepts we'll dive into production code to see how to:

- Deliver data to React components from localStorage or fetch remote data if needed;
- Handle API errors gracefully, retrying if possible, and, if not, warn the user and recover from optimistic UI updates that were made;
- Manage data to respect the browser's localStorage limits.
