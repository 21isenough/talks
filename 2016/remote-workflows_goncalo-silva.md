Description
-----------

Doist is a bootstrapped and profitable company with people working remotely from all over the world. It's growing steadily using solid processes to make the most out of its remote setting.

What's fascinating about it is the way it scaled from being a side-project of the founder, Amir Salihefendic, to a powerhouse with 50 people from 4 continents. 

Doist’s growth was completely organic, with many unforeseen factors that we had to learn as we progressed. Was there a well defined 10-year plan? No. Was there a lot of advice from people experienced in building remote companies? No. Was there a perfect book, with all the lessons that were needed? No.

We are as passionate about building a great company as we are about building great products. We learned by doing it. We did it by doing it. And we did it step by step. Ultimately, this trial and error approach to scaling a bootstrapped remote company taught us _a lot_.

This talk will let you in on the core processes that laid the foundations to achieve this. All major lessons, good and bad, in 30 minutes. Some of them, you'll find in books. Some, in common sense. Some others, you'll find in this talk.
