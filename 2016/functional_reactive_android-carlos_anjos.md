Description

###Functional
We'll be looking what it is, and why you should adopt a functional programming style no matter what language you're using (java, kotlin, scala, groovy, etc)

###Reactive
We'll be looking why the reactive extentions (http://reactivex.io/) are so great that got quickly adopted by other languages besides C#

###Android
Well, it's been my platform of choice for the last 7 years, but there's no need to shy away if that's not what you are using. Most code samples will be for this platform, though.

###Groovy
I gave it a shot a couple of months ago, and haven't looked back. I'll give several examples why you might consider it too. (note: it can be gentle, you don't have to switch everything to a completely different language all at once, so don't be shy)

Speaker Bio
-----------

![Speaker Image](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1188378?v=3&s=400)

I started as backend developer at INESC-INOV, doing platforms in Java and MySQL and squeezing every bit of performance that I could for portuguese and brazilian telcos dealing mainly with massive use of SMS.
Than started working for SAPO and transitioned to Android, pushing the envelope with slightly obscure compilers like AspectJ
Nowadays I'm working for Muzzley, an IoT startup.
Besides Android, I'm also interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence
