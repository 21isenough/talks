Chrome DevTools come with lots of features that allow developers to debug problems faster, stay productive, profile their web apps for bottlenecks and hunt down memory issues. I want to share my workflow on Chrome DevTools on how to achieve all that, together with the smallest of the tips and tricks that will make you fall in love with Chrome DevTools all over again.

Some of the features that I will talk about are:

- Profiling loadtime performance analysing network activity
- Profiling UI responsiveness using timeline view with flamecharts
- Profiling rendering performance for jank-free animations
- Auditing web app for memory leaks
- Emulating networks, devices and sensors
- Advanced JavaScript Debugging
- Staying productive with shortcuts

And finish off with:
- How to stay on the cutting edge of all this?

During the session, we will debug a Trello board of bugs on a dummy web app that mimics real-world problems using Chrome DevTools.

Prashant is a front-end developer who likes to look under the hood of the tools that he works with everyday. On an attempt to understand why the code that he wrote behaved the way it did in the browsers, he came across a number of tools that the browsers provided which helped him gain clarity on those matters. He believes in "learning by sharing" which is why he enjoys giving talks on this subject to help others catch up with the latest and greatest of these browser tools.
