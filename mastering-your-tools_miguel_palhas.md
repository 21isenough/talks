# Mastering your Tools

* Speaker: Miguel Palhas
* Length: 30-45 minutes
* Language: English

## Description

I'm all about performance. Not just code execution performance, but also the performance of my work tools, and of my usage of them.

From mechanical, customizable keyboards, to that one tiny configuration for my text editor that took me weeks to find, I'm always thinking about the way I do things, and how I could do them better.
Have you ever considered how many keys you hit during the day? How many mouse clicks? What are your most repetitive tasks? The ones you never really thought that could be automated, but actually can.

Having been an avid programmer for several years now, I've amassed a pretty good understanding of how to improve productivity when it comes to writing code.

This talk will feature some examples of very practical advices using my tools of choice (mostly Linux, Tmux, Vim & Ruby), but every piece of knowledge can be applied to other languages or technologies. Whether you're on Vim or Sublime Text, you should never feel limited by what you *think* your tool allows you to do.

## Speaker Bio

![Speaker Image](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/283819?v=3&s=400)

I've been working on the web For the past four years, mostly writing Ruby, but also some awesome web animation on the side.
I have a passion for Open-source, and for giving back to the community. I've taught programming to hundreds of people (between meetups, university courses, 1-1 mentoring, and even our own coding school), and have helped organize several meetups and development conferences (most notably RubyConf Portugal).
When I'm not busy building high-quality web code, or bothering others with my teachings, I might still be busy trying to become a real game developer. Being an astronaut is no longer an option, so that's the one childhood dream I still have going on.
