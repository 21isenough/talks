Description
-----------

We are living in an exciting New Age of Creation in which "making" is assuming more relevance. It's becoming easier to see an idea turn into reality, and that is excellent. However, it also places lots of challenges in our way since the pace of change is overwhelming. We can put in place mechanisms that allow us to keep moving forward without losing sense of the product security.

We will be speaking about behavior driven development, the creation of evil user stories, definition of security baselines and how we can embed them in the CI/CD pipelines. We will present security tools that can help us do it, explain their pros/cons, how we can create security tests with those tools and how we can integrate them with the CI/CD pipelines in an automated way.

The goal of the talk is to enable developers to create products with security in mind, using an organic and low friction approach between traditionally orthogonal incentives. To achieve this, the developer and the security guy should work as a true team. We will go through common methodologies/tools that bring together developers and security people, to allow them to work as a healthy team that shares the same goal: **Create a successful product**.
