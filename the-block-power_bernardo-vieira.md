Description
-----------

Yeah yeah, you heard about it, blockchain, I know. But it's 2019 and blockchain is 'still' around (some thought it will disappear).
Because there was already enough talks about what the hell blockchain is, this is a workshop to actually give you a hands on.
We will be using **ethereum** and *truffle*, but I might talk about *hyperledger fabric* in the end.
The objective is to show how easy it is. It does not require any knowledge, but beware that we will be working with *solidity* and *nodejs* (javascript). I will give the code.
Please join, brought questions, laptop or at least attention.
