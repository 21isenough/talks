Description
-----------

Yeah yeah, you heard about it, blockchain. But we are in 2019 and blockchain is 'still' around (some thought it would disappear). 
With [ethereum blockchain](https://www.ethereum.org/) and the help of the [truffle framework](https://truffleframework.com/) we will build a decentralized application.
We will use [solidity language](solidity.readthedocs.io) and [nodejs](nodejs.org) (javascript) although it does not require any previous knowledge. Please join, bring questions, a laptop or at least attention.
