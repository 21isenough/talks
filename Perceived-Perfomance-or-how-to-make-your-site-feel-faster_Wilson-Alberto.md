Nowadays everything should be a target for performance improvement and you get all sorts of ways 
to achieve the feeling that you have a faster website than your competition.

Progressive web apps, offline first, preloading, offline first, are just a few of the new different ways
to guarentee your website is performant and faster under the harshest of circumstances.

But still, there a few ways we can make our website feel a bit faster, just by making it look like its faster.

You can mess with how the regular user perceives how fast your site is by loading a skeleton of the page,
give him something to pass the time, give him a loading bar, etc.

Simple things that make the experience much richer and feel much faster.

This talk will run through some of these techniques and try to give a better understanding as to why something is fast
when in reality it definitely is not.
