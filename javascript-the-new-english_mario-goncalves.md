Description
-----------

Some say Javascript is eating the World; others say *~~Video~~ Javascript Killed The ~~Radio~~ Java Star*. Even though that is `== true`, it is not `===` so.

In this talk, we'll put the Web's *de facto* language in a *mano-a-mano* with the world's *lingua franca* and unveil the *je ne sais quoi* behind Javascript's *Zeitgeist* of popularity.

Speaker Bio
-----------

I'm Mário, a geek and developer who likes to learn, think, help and create.

The Web is my playground and the front-end tech has my favorite toys.

I also like to keep my thinking blade sharp and one of the most efficient ways to do that is to surround myself by the best and, since 2008, I've been fortunate to work with just those at Sky, E.Near, SAPO, ROFF, Kriação, Talent and CCL.

If I'm not exercising my *engineering no jutsu*, catch me up for a game of Magic: The Gathering.
