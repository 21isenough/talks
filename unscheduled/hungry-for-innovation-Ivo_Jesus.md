Description
-----------

This is a story about cakes and geeks. Everyday a "cake trolley" full of croissants and pastries enters the reception of the building. However, our company is one floor above it. When we notice its arrival it's already too late. But we are geeks, we are life hackers! So we used the [Internet Button](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/internet-button) to instantly notify us on Slack. And as a plus the receptionist can now play the Nyan Cat theme on demand. She loves it!
