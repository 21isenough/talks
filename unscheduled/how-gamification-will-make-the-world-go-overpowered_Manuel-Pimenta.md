Description
-----------

So there's this whole bunch of people called "Millennials" and "Gen Z" that were born 15 to 30 years ago right? 
And everyone talks about how they can't focus, or their recruitment demands are hard to match, or how they're impossible to manage.
Well they've clearly never led a 20 people raid on Sunwell and witness the power of a well done gear check. They're not aware that 20% of their colleagues have played at least 5 consecutive seasons on Football Manager, leading a 3rd Division clube to Champions League glory. They have no idea what it means to be one of the people to hit 400 on Flappy Bird. They've never left home at 3 a.m. to catch a Pikachu in Parque Eduardo VII.
And that's what I want to share you: the Epic Quest of a Gamification Designer, to bring that power that games have mastered, beyond the simple points, badges and leaderboards trope, to all the Muggles out there and lead them... to Victory! 
For the Horde!!!

Speaker Bio
-----------

I'm a Gamification Designer at Novabase, with a background in software development, analysis and overall coding magic.
I'm seriously passionate about using game mechanics and game design techniques to solve problems and engage people, and I've been spreading the fun in domains like eLearning, employee engagement and ideation for the last four years.
I'm also a Design Thinking and Gamification Design coach, was co-organizer of Novabase Gameshifters for the past 2 years, I'm a Gamer, a Scout leader, an aspiring blogger/writer, a musician in denial and I can hit a low C in the morning.
At the end of the day, I'm just a firm believer that games and gamification will change the world. One gamer at a time.
