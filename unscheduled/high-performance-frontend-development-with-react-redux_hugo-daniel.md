Description
-----------

In this talk I am going to talk about writing high-performance web applications.

Along the way the avid listener will be equiped with a set of good JavaScript coding practices (performance-wise).

Overview:

* How JavaScript works with the browser (parsers/reflows/renderers)
* How does the Garbage Collector work (generational buffers and the cycle counter)
* How to win the battle against the DOM
* A quick overview of React and Redux (to smooth beginners)
* Techniques to squeeze the ultimate drop of performance out of them

Join the trenches if any of these interest you :D
