Description
-----------

We have seen and read a lot stuff about this new silver bullet in software engineering, the solution to all your problems, this new thing they call *microservices*.
Well, if you are looking for that on this talk then *this is not the talk you are looking for!!*

In this talk I will explore some of the pitfalls and common problems that turn your new microservices architecture into a living nightmare, moving you from the promised land directly to hell...
I will approach some solutions to common problems and in some case most likely advise you to drop microservices until you are ready for it.

Speaker Bio
-----------

I am awesome! INDEED... :D [But elaborate why]

Technology Evangelist at Singular, I love to explore new technologies and find solutions for problems our customers have on daily basis.

I have been working with SOA and distributed architectures for the past 7/8 years and spent the last 4 years migrating "giants" into microservices and building new microservices architectures. I also spent most of this time facing big walls and entering into giant holes. Since the easiest way to learn is with your mistakes, I'd like to share them with others.
