Description
-----------

You know tensorflow but never used ? Or perhaps you don't even know ?

Tensorflow is being one of the most used machine learning systems and it's possible to do anything you can imagine, since a simple code that recognize 4bits patterns to build music tracks. It's insanely awesome.

Join this talk to learn a little bit about how tensorflow works, learn some methods, build a basic number and character recognition system, use tensorboard and see what else we can do with this amazing system.

Speaker Bio

I've been passionated about machine learning for a while. This last year I decide to dedicate some of my time to this subject and build a number and character recognition system, and then I though that wold be nice to share everything I learned meanwhile I was doing this.

I finished my BSc this year in July in ISEC (Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra)
