[ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/) is a highly customizable log shipping and log visualization stack. Running on AWS, Digital Ocean or self-hosted, it allows a fast and scalable iteration through stored logs / information. The ELK stack is Open Source software.

ELK stack is composed by:
Elastic Search (Distributed, scalable, Real-time search and analytics capabilities, RESTful API);
Kibana (Flexible analytics and visualization platform, Real-time summary and charting of streaming data);
Logstash (Centralize data processing of all types, Quickly extend to custom log formats, Easily add plugins for custom data sources);
Filebeat (Lightweight data shippers for many types of data you want to enrich with Logstash).

All these tools can also work as standalone.

In this talk, we'll go really fast through the entire ELK stack programs. Demo will focus on quickly setup ELK stack, logstash filters and data visualization.
