Description

Companies see their data as a valuable source of information and insights. As the number of data sources grow, the amount of available data also increases, and the technologies used to process and analyze data consequently change. This data increase had as a consequence the appearance and rise of a new field in Data Science: Big Data. Big Data technologies are used to process large amounts of data, making use of the expansion of processing power, as well as the decreasing costs in cloud computing.

Aptoide's motto is "Own your Android Store", meaning that any user can have a store and anyone can subscribe to any (public) store. This concept is used to leverage the Android app store experience for its users since it allows for an easier app discovery process and grants a social aspect to the app stores. As a step further in the user experience effort, Aptoide took the decision of using its data to give users customized content based on how they use Aptoide's Android app and what they have installed on their smartphones. This meant gather relevant content and match it with data coming from 2.3 million daily users.

This talk will be focused on the steps taken to implement a Big Data architecture capable scaling, both horizontal and vertically, to handle the increasing number of Aptoide users, all the way from data gathering to making content available to users.
