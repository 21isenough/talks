Surviving the offline status
========================

* Speakers  : Rafael Fernandes and Antoni Huguet Vives
* Length    : 40 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

The world has witnessed a web-app revolution, this revolution came with libraries and frameworks popping left, right and center.

Join us in a journey back to the origins, a travel to understand the technologies that rule the web and explore two of any web-app's frontiers:
 
 * The user interface - with web components
 * The network or specially the lack of it… Think and design "offline first".

To do so, we are going to explain and demonstrate the necessary concepts to make the essential part of your app available offline with a snappy look and feel: 

- Philosophy behind it - no more offline screens and faster loading times.
- User interaction: communicate what’s going on and what to expect from our offline app.
- Web components.
- Web workers.
- Service workers.
- Using IndexedDB.

We intend to show you how easy is to build a simple and efficient web app that can "survive" intermittent Internet connectivity without affecting user experience.

ANTONI HUGUET VIVES

Antoni is a senior front-end developer focused on architecture, performance and data visualisation: he basically likes to create fast useful things that are nice to interact with! He has always demanded the same characteristic from all projects he worked with: it must provide a technical challenge. His never-ending curiosity pushes him to spend nights reading posts about the new internet standards (great fan of ES 2015 and ES2016 by the way!). He feels happy whenever he can mix these new fresh tech ingredients and bake them into lovely apps. When any of his web apps are delicious enough to satisfy consumers and pleasant for his colleagues to work with he feels one with the universe. He believe now it’s time to share all the passion and knowledge he happened to learn during those years so he recently decided to start participating in talks.

RAFAEL FERNANDES

He's experienced Javascript Padawan (he’ll never consider himself a Jedi Master!) who started working as a full-stack web developer who gradually shifted to frontend as the years passed by.
He worked enterprise-like environments, got tired of it and now happily abolished ties from his wardrobe. A lover of good UX,  his main objective in life (besides finding a non-fattening chocolate fountain) is to create a web apps that are fast, clean and easy to use that makes everybody’s life easier.
His projects involved clients like Companhia de Seguros Tranquilidade, Astra-Zeneca, Thales, Nuon and Via Verde. Oh, and everybody calls him Rafa!

Both Rafael and Antoni work for NonDutch, lending their expertise so that companies can reach their potential, stretching the limits of technology while doing so.
