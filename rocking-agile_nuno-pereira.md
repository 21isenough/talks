Description
-----------
 
Do you believe that agile is only for IT teams? You’re wrong. I have been using agile methodologies for a while with IT teams and as a passioned amateur musician having played in several band i thought "How the hell can we work as an agile team in a rock band?". I had the opportunity 2 years ago to start a new band and try this from scratch. I’ll show you the journey so far and how we survived the constant changes and transformed into a better, motivated and more efficient band adapting agile methodologies and procedures like TDD, standups, retrospectives, etc.
