Description
-----------

KODI is a nice piece of software, NOS Discos is a cool site to discover new Portuguese music artists. Mixing both is just a geeky thing.

---------------
KODI is a pretty nice entertainment thing, specially when combined with Raspberry Pi and an Internet connection. It is great to:
* watch on-line videos (ARTE Concert and TED Talks are a MUST!);
* get weather information in the morning so we can decide what (not) to wear;
* avoid extra scratches on CDs and DVDs;
* bore our guests with the photos taken during our last vacations (and expect them to leave);
* ...

NOS Discos is a great place to get in touch with new Portuguese music for free but... who really accesses a web-site nowadays? Single purpose "apps" on our set-top boxes (media centres), phones and tablets (almost) killed the general purpose browser usage. So let's bring NOS Discos to the media centre and make music available at users' will!

Speaker Bio
-----------

I am awesome! Well, at least the Pixels Camp template says I am... In fact I'm just a boring geek guy when I am with non-geek friends and a boring music-lover when I am among geeks. So how did it start? Well, during my early years my favourite toys were electrical cables, damaged toasters, radios... Then a computer came to my life when I was 9 and my parents realised they ruined my childhood. I spent hours and hours exploring and thinking how could I do something with that boxy beige thing. My first big project was a newspaper and it was inspired by a car-crash my mother had.
When I was 14, me and a friend were doing our very first software piece for real usage! It was written in Clipper and it helped to manage a daycare centre.
I went to college in the technological branch of science studies where I met a new reality: the Internet! Once again, I just didn't feel right as a spectator - I had to develop things for this new media. I found myself studying Perl to help me to generate some static HTML files. I then reinvented it to run as a CGI on the server-side. Later on I did Erasmus in Glasgow developing in Python and PgSQL.
Shortly after finishing my studies, I co-founded Porto Linux community. I still don't feel right as a mere spectator.
