Description
-----------

KODI is a nice piece of software, NOS Discos is a cool site to discover new Portuguese music artists. Mixing both is just a geeky thing.

---------------
KODI is a pretty nice entertainment thing, specially when combined with Raspberry Pi and an Internet connection. It is great to:
* watch on-line videos (ARTE Concert and TED Talks are a MUST!);
* get weather information in the morning so we can decide what (not) to wear;
* avoid extra scratches on CDs and DVDs;
* bore our guests with the photos taken during our last vacations (and expect them to leave);
* ...

NOS Discos is a great place to get in touch with new Portuguese music for free but... who really accesses a web-site in these days? Single purpose "apps" on our set-top boxes (media centres), phones and tablets (almost) killed the general purpose browser usage. So let's bring NOS Discos to the media centre and make music available at users' will!

Speaker Bio
-----------

I am awesome! Well, at least the Pixels Camp template says I am... In fact I'm just a boring geek guy when I am with non-geek friends and a boring music-lover when I am between geeks. So how it started? Well, during my early years my favourite toys were electrical cables, damaged toasters, radios... Then a computer - not any computer, it was a awesome 8086 at 12MHz with no less than 640KB of RAM and a fully 20MB HDD! - came to my life when I was 9 and my parents realised they ruined my childhood: no more LEGO, no more puzzles, no more nothing! Hours and hours were spent exploring and thinking how could I do something with that boxy thing. My first big project was a newspaper and it was inspired by a car-crash my mother had (no physical injuries on her, thanks for asking). Three years later I found out that an older neighbour was at professional school studying programming and I got interested on that so I asked him to give me some hints and to supply me the compiler. Two years later me and my neighbour friend were doing our very first software piece for real usage! It was written in Clipper and it helped to manage a daycare centre for four years. Then the college in the technological branch of science studies and a new reality: the Internet! Once again, I couldn't feel right as a spectator so I had to find out something to make me develop things for this new media. I found myself studying Perl to help me to generate some static HTML files for Recognize Fanclub, the fan club of the best rock band ever: Blind Zero. Then CGI and Perl on the server-side, then migration to PHP (hey! everybody makes mistakes every now and then!), then Erasmus in Glasgow developing in Python and PgSQL, then finished my studies, then missed the academic Linux community I was part of, then co-founded Porto Linux community...
