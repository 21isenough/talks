Description
-----------

If you're an Android developer, you've probably heard of [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). It's filled with immense promise, bringing a beautiful, concise and full-featured programming language to all Android developers. No need to wait 10 years to be able to use `minSdkVersion 24`. Most of the sweet features in Java 8, and many more, are at your reach _now_.

[Anko](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko), by the same folks at JetBrains, is not so consensual. You might say it promotes mixing UI with business logic. You might say its performance over regular layout inflation makes it worth it. You might praise its carefully thought–out utilities. You might dismiss them as bloat.

The new Todoist for Android Wear, [previewed at Google I/O's keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=862r3XS2YB0&t=4839), is a full-featured stand-alone Wear app fully written using Kotlin and Anko.

This talk will walk you through some of the highlights of going all in with Kotlin and Anko. The meatiest of meats. Enough of code samples — let's see how these behave when developing for millions.
