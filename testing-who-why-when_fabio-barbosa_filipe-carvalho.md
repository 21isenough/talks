Description
-----------

Testing… everyone knows it exists, some talk about it, few do it, even fewer do it well. Testing is an activity, not a state in the end of the production line of a software product, that says ‘yey’ or ‘nei’. For that, test automation is a must. And test automation is often neglected. 
By exploring the test pyramid we will give a context for each type and which metrics we should use. It will be an open discussion about who, why and when we should test. 
We have been implementing automation in Mobile development with automated UI test, static analysis, dependency checks and updates, automated pipelines and other activities that help decreasing the time spent in each release/merge and at the same time increase the stability of the products. 
We would like to share our thoughts and background in this matter and also hear the experiences from other attendees, since this area, like many others, is in constant development and evolution. Come and find out the value of testing!
