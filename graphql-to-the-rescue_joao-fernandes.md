Description
-----------

Does your web API look like an octopus, featuring more endpoints than Linux has system calls? Feeling like madness by now? Or are you constantly overfetching data from your backend and/or making your clients go through a gazillion roundtrips to get all the data they need? Then lets talk about GraphQL, Facebook's new data query language and gift to the world.

I'm proposing a 70-30% theoretical/practical talk about how GraphQL is shaping web development, and for that we will cover (WIP agenda!)

- Basics of GraphQL (why it was born and what is it)
- The impact on frontend development (e.g., queries, mutations, caching, tooling)
- The impact on backend development (e.g., schemas, scaling, tooling)
- Should you use it? (e.g., maturity, future plans for the language)
