Description
-----------

Sharing passwords and secrets have always been a big "headache" for Security and Ops Teams, because not only these teams want to control who has access to what, but want to be able to react faster when there is the suspicion that a leak has happened.
Two simple examples are when Dev team want's to run a Data Repair Script, they need to either create a container and have Ops inject the credentials they need via Env Variables (Not recommended) or they need to send the script to Ops, have them modify it with the credentials and execute it (Error Prone). The other example is when attackers gain access to your database credentials by exploring remote-code execution exploits to dump the Environment Variables, you want to be able to invalidate old credentials and generate new ones quickly.

This talk will introduce you to Vault by HashiCorp. I'll show you some use-cases and workflows on how we can control access to services in general just by using Tokens.
