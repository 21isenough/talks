# How To Propose a Talk for Pixels Camp 2019

Talk proposals for [Pixels Camp](https://pixels.camp) must be submitted as GitHub pull requests. Please follow these steps:

1. Make sure you're logged in to **GitHub**;
2. **Fork** this repository into your account;
3. **Copy** the `talk-title_presenter-name.md` template into a **new file**;
4. Rename the **new file** using your talk's title and your name (eg. `introduction-to-foo_john-doe.md`);
5. Edit the **new file** and fill in each section (**do not delete the template file**);
6. When you're done, submit a **Pull Request**.

Use your talk's title as the PRs title and use the contents of your proposal as its description. This will help with the revision process as well as allow the public to comment/vote on proposals.

**NOTE:** If you're proposing more than one talk, please open **separate** Pull Requests.

## What Happens Next?

* Your proposal will be reviewed by the Pixels Camp organizers.
* You'll be asked for more information, or to touch up existing information.
* If your talk is accepted, we'll merge the PR.
* You'll get feedback even if the talk isn't accepted.

## Rules

* The deadline for submitting talks is **January 20th, 2019**. After that we won't accept any more proposals;
* Speakers must also be participants, you **must** also apply for Pixels Camp here: https://pixels.camp;
* Having your talk accepted also means you're accepted as an attendee (of course);
* Proposals must have a minimum set of information (see the template) to be considered for revision;
* Talk slots may be 30 or 60 minutes long (minus setup time). Only workshops may have longer slots;
* Talks may be delivered in English or Portuguese, but talk proposals **must always** be written in English.

## Contact Information

Make sure we have a way to contact you privately if needed. Set up an e-mail address in your GitHub profile or include it with your proposal. Also make sure you join us at [Slack](https://slack.pixels.camp).

## What Makes a Good Proposal?

There aren't any hard rules besides making it honest and as captivating as you can. We do have a few suggestions though:

* Make it **HARD-CORE** — This doesn't mean the topic needs to be advanced, far from it, it means you'll be speaking to a technical audience made out of intelligent people and shouldn't avoid going all technical. People **love** the gory details.
* Make it **PERSONAL** — Especially if you'll be talking about some introductory topic, make sure you add something of yourself to the subject. Anyone can google for information these days, so remember the audience will be mostly looking for your personal experience on the matter.
* Make it **RELEVANT** — The audience at Pixels Camp has very diverse interests so, if you think about it, almost any topic will be interesting to some subset of the attendees. Don't limit yourself to popular topics or the new shiny, think more about knowledge sharing. If you're interested in some subject and are willing to talk about it on stage, chances are other attendees will be willing to hear you.
* Make it **CLEAR** — People are more likely to be interested in attending your talk if they get a clear idea of what you'll be talking about. Polish your talk description with clear wording and proper english, and try to come up with an interesting title. Don't overdo it, though... Like code, excess cleverness may actually work against you.

## I Got Accepted!

Congratulations! You're an MVP (_Most Valuable Pixel... Camper_). The Pixels Camp organizers will be contacting you about some logistics details soon. Meanwhile, you can contact us over [Slack](https://slack.pixels.camp) (privately or on `#speakers` channel).

## I Got Rejected, Now What?

If your talk proposal gets rejected, don't be disappointed. Don't give up, you may get your chance next time.

Your talk might not have made it for any number of reasons and, most of the time, they have nothing to do with quality or your ability to deliver. Maybe a similar topic got covered in the previous year, or this year, and the reviewers decided not to run it this time. Maybe there were too many similar talks and the reviewers opted for other subjects. Or maybe your proposal just didn’t quite convince us this time around.

Either way, what really matters is that you submitted a talk proposal and you've shown motivation and initiative, which are just the kind of attributes we're looking for in attendees. Karma points for you!

Thanks,

The Pixels Camp crew
