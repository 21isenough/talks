## How to submit a talk

Talk proposals are handled through GitHub Pull Requests. Follow the instructions below:

* Make sure you're logged in to **GitHub**;
* **Fork** this repository into your account;
* **Duplicate** the `my-awesome-talk_my-name.md` template into a **new file**;
* Rename the **new file** using your talk's title and your name
(eg: `pixels-camp-is-going-to-be-legen-dary_celso-martinho.md`);
* Edit the **new file** and fill in each section (**do not delete the template file**);
* When you're ready, submit a **Pull Request** and paste your markdown file contents into the **first comment**.

**Note:** If you're proposing more than one talk, please open **separate** Pull Requests.

### What happens next?

* Anyone can comment (and vote) on your Pull Request.
* If your talk is accepted we will merge the Pull Request.
* We'll give feedback to anyone who submits a talk proposal even if isn't accepted.

The deadline for submitting talks is **July 31st**. After than we won't be accepting any more Pull Requests.

Speakers must also be participants, so don't forget to **apply** for Pixels Camp here: https://pixels.camp


## What should be in the proposal?

Every proposal should have, at minimum, the following information:

* Your Name
* Your Availability (what days/times you are able to do this presentation)
* Presentation Title
* Presentation Description
* Presentation Duration (typically 30 mins, but we're open minded)
* Presentation Language


#### Related Files

If you want to include any other files related to your presentation, like keynotes, code samples, videos, etc, make a directory with the same name as your presentation and put the files in there.

#### Contact Info

Make sure we have a way to contact you! Either set up your e-mail address in your GitHub profile, or include it on your proposal.


## What are we looking for?

#### Relevance

* Is the talk relevant for the Pixels Camp attendance?
* Does it make sense for a bunch of hard code technical audience to sit through your talk in the context of Pixels Camp?

Relevance is tricky as it doesn’t necessarily translate to geeky or codable. Sometimes interesting talks show up and aren’t even related to technology.

#### Novelty

* Is it old news?
* Has it been heavily discussed in the past?

Sometimes good talks get rejected because they get old. Try to awe the attendees with fresh insights!
