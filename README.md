How to submit a Talk
========================

Talks proposals are handled through GitHub pull requests. Follow the instructions below:

* Log in to **GitHub** or create an account.
* **Fork this repository**.
* Duplicate the [my-awesome-talk_my-name.md](https://github.com/PixelsCamp/talks_2016/blob/master/my-awesome-talk_my-name.md) file and rename it after your talk title and your name.  
(ex: pixels-camp-is-going-to-be-legen-dary_celso-martinho.md)

* Edit the file and fill in each section.
* When you're ready, **submit a pull request**.
* Anyone can comment your pull request. If your talk is accepted we will merge it.
* We will respond to everyone who submits a proposal even if it's not accepted.


What should be in the proposal?
-------------------------------

Every proposal should have, at minimum, the following information: 

* Your Name
* Your Availability (what days/times you are able to do this presentation)
* Presentation Title
* Presentation Description
* Presentation Duration (typically 30 mins, but we're open minded)


### Related Files

If you want to include any other files related to your presentation, like keynotes, code samples, videos, etc, make a directory with the same name as your presentation and put the files in there.

### Contact Info

Make sure we have a way to contact you! Either set up your e-mail address in your GitHub profile, or include it on your proposal. If we accept your talk, we'll need a way to contact you.


What are we looking for?
------------------------

### Relevance

Is the talk relevant for the PixelsCamp attendance? Namely, would it make sense for a bunch of nerds to sit through your talk in the context of a technological event?  
Relevance is tricky as it doesn’t necessarily translate to geeky or codable. Sometimes interesting talks show up and aren’t even related to technology.

#### Novelty

Is it old news? Has it been heavily discussed in the past? Sometimes good talks get rejected because they get old. Try to awe the attendees with some fresh insights!
