Remotely Working
========================

Description
-----------

Two years ago I started working for a **100% remote development agency**. We work with industry giants and we're all around the world. This talk is about sharing the journey from being doubtful it would ever work to a remote working evangelist.

####Questions I will answer:

* How do you deal with seemly impossible time zones?
* Don't clients require you to have meetings at 03:00 AM?
* Is your team reliable?
* Isn't working in an office more inspiring? Don't you learn more?
* Anyone can work remotely?
* What lessons did you learn during your experience that can be applied to other companies both local and remote?

I'm an iOS developer. Did some backend Java ages ago. For the last two years I've been doing everything from project managing, leading a dev team, mentoring, backend dev, teaching, and hacking some marketing and sales.
