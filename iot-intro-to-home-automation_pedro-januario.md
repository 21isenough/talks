Speaker Bio
-----------

Technology Evangelist at Singular, I love to explore new technologies and find solutions for problems our customers have on daily basis.

I have been working with SOA and distributed architectures for the past 10 years and spent the last 6 years migrating "giants" into microservices and building new microservices architectures.
Home automation have been one of my geek interests since I graduated and did my thesis around the subject, 12 years later I am building a new house and creating my first home automation system. I would like to share what I learned about home automation current landscape and also since the easiest way to learn is with your mistakes, I'd like to share them with others.
