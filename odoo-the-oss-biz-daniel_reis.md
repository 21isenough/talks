==================================================================

* Available : October 8th, any hour
* Length    : 30 mins should be fine


Description
-----------

Business processes are tricky.

Robust apps are hard to build.

Web frameworks are great to build the perfect front end,
but not very helpful at *tying all the pieces together in the backend*.

Get that out of the way: *let the Odoo framework do the heavy lifting* for you,
and *focus at excelling on your business idea*.

Odoo, formerly known as OpenERP, is a rapid application development framework,
a the business apps platform, and a CRM/ERP/eCommerce product.

It is an open source project, created and driven the the Belgian company
with the same name, with the key distinctive feature that it is
*built to be extended*: at the view, model and business logic
layers.

The net effect of this was the growth of a *vibrant community* around it,
with *thousand of extension modules already available, both free and
paid*. The community leaders joined together to found the Odoo Community Association,
a non-profit organization to organize collaboration and actively promote *quality
open source modules*.

Odoo is a modern and rich platform that can provide a huge headstart
to build a software application solutions, either by *leveraging the RAD
features on a prototype phase*, or it's *robustness and scalability at the business operation phase*.

As an interesting reference, the largest Odoo/OpenERP installation in the world is at the Portuguese
Education Ministry, with 500k users and the deployment of more than 200 apps.

The goal for this talk is to provide an introduction and overview to Odoo,
to *help enterpreneurs to consider and evaluate Odoo as a
possible component to implementation of their business idea*.
