Description
-----------

Unbabel empowers with Artificial Intelligence a community of 40K+ translators worldwide to increase the speed of delivering human quality translation and dramatically reduce translation costs. It does so by relying in a complex symbiosis between man and machine. From machine translation and automatic post-editing, to quality estimation, AI powered grammar correction, and smart translator selection based on their past usage, Unbabel employs a wide range of machine learning and natural language processing tools. In this talk I will describe those tools, and how they interact with the crowd of human translators. In a world where the Internet is diverging by the emergence of multiple language-centric internets, Unbabel is uniting these internets to extend the global reach of businesses worldwide.
