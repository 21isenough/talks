Description
-----------

In order to fully test our applications we have to cover a lot of ground, and with microservices, we have added another level of complexity.

When developing multiple microservices that needs to integrate with each other we have to ensure that when we deploy a new service to production,
our changes won't break any consumer.

We can do this kind of testing without the need of a real consumer by using a consumer-driven contract.

In this talk I will show you how to implement consumer-driven contracts and we'll move TDD to the level of software architecture.
