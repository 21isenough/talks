This talk is about how a culture of data sharing and transparency in government institutions, can bring important and unexpected changes to society. To illustrate this point, I'm going to talk about Melhor da Zona, a web app that lets you search the best driving schools in your area.

The idea was born out of the realization that the only metric for comparing driving schools the students had was the driving school's "license" price. This creates an unfortunate situation where schools are forced to compete for low prices, compromising on quality. Also, schools lose all incentives to provide a better service because the teaching quality, ie pass rates, are never publicly recognized. If this information was publicly know, then students would be able to compare price against quality and make a better informed decision.

On the beginning of 2015, the Institute for Transport and Mobility (IMT) published the pass rates of driving schools, with a break down for theoretical exams, practical exams, B and other category.

Our idea, a very simple one, to aggregate the scattered data for pass rates and addresses and assign a searchable geo index to them, received a divided reaction from driving schools. Those how were very pleased and, understandably, those who were very angry. Defamatory blog posts and minor threats followed, together with  complaints about the data origin and "the IMT criteria".

However, the only change we introduced was data accessibility. The data was already available to begin with the only difference was that now there was an intuitive way to query. This was the difference between students knowing or not knowing about it and driving schools ignoring it or being very worried. 

Put in another way, we basically solved the UX problem and the lesson to be learned is that if the data is just dumped in a location, users can't do much with it, they can't reason about it and in case like this, it's equal to not being there at all.

What other examples are out there? What other use cases and shifts to happen by having government institutions to release them, even if having an API at least a publicly accessible csv.
