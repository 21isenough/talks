Description
-----------

**In a hole in the ground there lived a software engineer that had to deal with blocking code. His jurney of avoiding the spaghetti code monster begins in the wasteland of busywait, continues through the hell of callbacks, towards the light of promises, past the promised land of generators and finally ends with an epic battle on the fields async/await.**

The talk will focus on the problem of blocking code. We will look into how you can speed up your app by going async and when it won't improve performance at all. We will look at how different programming languages help us deal with async code and mention some good and bad practices to make sure our async code is performant and readable.

Speaker Bio
-----------

I'm a digital nomad from 🇸🇮Slovenia that has decided to settle down here in 🇵🇹Portugal.

My day job is writing Python, Javascript and reviewing code other people write. In my spare time I work on personal projects ranging from IRC bots to web and mobile games (all open source on my github account, even my day job project!).

When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably out in the lineup catching some surf (one of the main reasons why I decided to move to Portugal). 🌊🏄
