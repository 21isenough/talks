Description
-----------

I'm just a regular guy who used to think databases were the most boring piece of technology out there.
To me, Artificial Intelligence was where all the cool kids were at but after starting to work at MemSQL,
a database company, I was surprised to find out that databases are _actually_ cool.

Because of that, I decided I should talk about my experiences with working on databases, as well as
give a general idea of the current state of databases, because choosing your database is as important
as choosing your programming language these days (SQL vs NoSQL I'm looking at you).

If you're still wondering about what exactly this talk is going to be about, then expect all kinds of cool  things
such as distributed queries, query rewrites, code generation, query plans, statistics, real time analytics and
other optimizations such as hash joins and bloom filters.

tl;dr: Whether you're really into databases or just use them because you have to, show up because I can
guarantee you'll learn about very useful things.
