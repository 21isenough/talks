Description
-----------

All who have played with JavaScript have felt what R. Kelly believes to be [`flying`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIQn8pab8Vc).

Unfortunately, during these flights we can find some cold breezes that make us think *"What the f**"*. Well, in JavaScript, these WTFs are just the way it is. Sometimes you're flying just nice, others you're crashing cold.

Let's fly for a minute:
```js
true + true === 2   // true
true - true === 0   // true
true === 1
```
I know the felling :shit:

Fortunately, for all weird things there's always an explanation (except maybe for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1eHKf-dMwo)) and JavaScript is no exception.

**In this talk we will see some of the JavaScript's weirdest things and try to understand how and why they happen.**

The only requirement for this talk is to listen to [`Never Gonna Give You Up`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) from Rick Astley. Some of these things are really mind blowing.
