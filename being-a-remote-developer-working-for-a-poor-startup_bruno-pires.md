Description
-----------

Nowadays with the tools, the super-fast internet and the new mindset being practiced across multiple countries, the concept of being a remote worker is changing.

It's moving away from being the dream of many and the reality of a few, to a new trend, moreover in the startup world, the real one, where companies that almost no one knows, struggle to keep up with the challenges, goals and deadlines and, at the same time need to deal with the limited availability of developers within their region, that want to work for a early stage company.

This is not a tale about the startups you read about in TechCrunch, Wired, Mashable or see in "Silicon Valley" tv series, this is not about companies that can afford to offer 10k for a new hire to choose their desktop setup, so they can feel comfortable and happy.

This is about the 99.5% of the startups you never heard about, the ones that need to hire carefully, the ones that need a developer that makes things happen without a huge team behind him, a jack of all trades that they can afford and that, somehow is up to the challenge and willing to face the rollercoaster full of uncertainties that is working for an startup, work long hours and with luck, get an average salary with almost no benefits.

These companies are looking for developers like you, yes you!!!

They are don't care if you work from home/coffe/beach, that you only work from 6pm to 2am because that's when you are productive, they don't care if you are in a different time-zone and don't speak their native language (as long as you speak English).

They just care about three things: you get the job done, you are available (also when $%&## hits the fan) and that you learn from your mistakes.
