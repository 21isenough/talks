Description
-----------

Since Swift was announced 2 years ago, all shiny and new, I wanted to use it in Production right away. Big problem is, unless you are starting a new project from scratch, chances are you will have to deal with Obj-C in the mix.

But then a wild opportunity appears, re-invent an app, from scratch. And when I say from scratch I mean *really* from scratch, not even a dependency on which language it would be developed.

_Functional Reactive Programming_ (FRP) is not that new, it has been around since the last century, but it's shiny, it has been reinventing itself and in consequence has been getting traction with amazing APIs such as _ReactiveX_.

My goal is to present my process of learning what FRP was, what was the thought process behind it and how using it made my Swift project more concise and easier to understand.
