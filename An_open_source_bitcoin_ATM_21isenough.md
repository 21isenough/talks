Description
-----------

I built an open source Bitcoin ATM. Throw 2 cents (or any other denomination) into the ATM and receive Bitcoin straight to your mobile Bitcoin wallet. It leverages the power of the Lightning Network - a second layer solution to bitcoins strong and secure base protocol.

Forget about the clunky and heavy machines in every other street - this is the new generation of ATMs. Not only will I talk about all the technical details and what hardware is being used for this ATM but I will also elaborate on the possibilities such a project can have on a global scale for the adoption of bitcoin.

Speaker Bio
-----------

I'm a bitcoin enthusiast and I breathe bitcoin. The fascination reaches from its technical underpinnings to the history of money to economic theories. Never in my life have I been so fascinated and bedazzled by one topic and all its implications.

We need a uncorrupted form of money, free from government intervention. Bitcoin makes this possible and is the most promising solution to this problem.

Extra Information
-----------------

The response I got from the Bitcoin community after publishing my open source Bitcoin ATM where quite overwhelming. There is clearly a need for this! Would be great to spread the word about it farther and wider.
