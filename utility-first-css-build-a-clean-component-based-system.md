Description
-----------

You may be familiar with the time when the CSS of your application reaches the point when you start adding some weird classes like:

`.title--24px`, `.section__big--diff-2`, `button-primary--important`, etc, â€¦

This often happens when you receive that request from the Stakeholders to have the same panel element, but with some slight differences? Or maybe that express request for an individual primary button to have more space on the top?

So, instead of creating some `later.css`, or just add `!important` here and there, join us and hear how and why an utility-first approach could save you a lot of timeâ€¦ but most of all, some big headaches.

Extra Information
-----------------

The value prop of this talk is to help any Front-end developer that can relate to the same struggles. And with my own experience, and some ðŸ”¥ tips, I will show some real-case examples that either give you the _"Aha! moment"_, or just learn something new.

To wrap it upâ€¦ the key point can be presented in under 30 minutes. But I prefer to extend to 45 minutes, so I can show some examples.
