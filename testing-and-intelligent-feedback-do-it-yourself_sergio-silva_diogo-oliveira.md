Testing and Intelligent Feedback - Do it yourself!
========================

* Speaker   : Sérgio Silva, Diogo Oliveira
* Length    : 30 mins
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

Do you feel that software testing is a strange and unnecessary thing only done at NASA to build unbreakable rockets and satellites? 

Do you want to know why is it important to write tests for the software your build, no matter its size, no matter the team, from the beginning? And no, it's not for the sake of testing!

In this presentation we will shed some light on these questions, show you that developers can learn a lot from using and breaking (!) tests and from having an appropriate feedback on their results, and we will also encourage you to build things in your own way as long as you feel the need for it. 

We will show you why and how did we built our own path to creating an awesome and stable product, continuously and by default, as well as how are we benefiting from it on a daily basis!

**Sérgio Silva**

I have an MSc in Computer Science at FCT/UNL, where I’ve developed my passion for both software and teaching - I taught some courses like Compilers, Operating Systems and Algorithms.

Afterwards, I joined OutSystems in 2013, where I’ve been proudly developing the OutSystems Platform. Today, I’m a team leader at OutSystems, working together with awesome people to develop and improve the Platform’s IDE and generated apps. When I’m not doing that, I’m constantly trying to figure out better ways to make everyone more productive - myself included since I’m lazy -, and that’s led me to help improve our quality process at the company.

My hobbies involve travel, playing games, cooking for friends and martial arts.

**Diogo Oliveira**

I have a MSc in Computer Science at UBI, where I’ve developed a particular passion for software quality and software reliability. During my MSc I also had the chance to teach Object Oriented Programming and Web Programming.

I first joined OutSystems in 2014 with a scholarship to work on my Master’s thesis, and later in 2015 I joined the company as a Software Engineer in the R&D Productivity Team. Today, I work in this team, which is constantly focused on improving the productivity of our developers, whether that has to do with tools or processes.

My main hobbies involve discovering great places in the middle of nature, cooking and watching comedy stuff.
