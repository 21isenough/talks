========================

Description
-----------

There are a few misconceptions about what doing sales is about:
* Sales has for years been associated with manipulative and annoying people that want you to buy what you don't need or want.
* We suppose that if we're not an extrovert, then we can't make sales.
* We believe that a good salesman are people who just need a script and a bag full of tricks and tactis.

Part of it may actually have been true in the past, but times are changing. 

In this talk I want to show you why and what things have changed in sales.
I want to show you that selling (ideas) is part of our lives, and that we all should learn how to do it - at this precise moment I'm selling to you my presentation.
I want to show you that sales is a lot about being helpful and providing value, in a honest manner. 
I want to show that you, geek as me, are on a great position to do sales for your field.
