Description
-----------

Monads are an advanced programming concept that can be used in any computer language by beginners.

They are also known to be very hard to explain and to lead those who venture into confusion and frustration.

In this talk I don't intend to explain what they are or how they work (way smarter people than me have tried this without success).

Instead I decided to center the subject on the usual canonical programming examples that are used to explain your typical programming paradigms, that way I hope to enable the audacious to decompose any problem with monads.

I will lead the audience through a set of carefully collided examples so that they can see past the magical mythical golden aura that Monads have and realize the true trash cans that they really are.

Speaker Bio
-----------

I have been coding in Haskell for many years and since the day that i started that i absolutely hate it. In spite of that someone recently told me that i have a [pt git award for it](http://git-awards.com/users?country=portugal&language=haskell), which is a highly sophisticated way of saying that if i was a dog i would be a chihuahua
