Description
-----------

TypeScript is just like the JavaScript of the future. Literally: it's JavaScript
with lots of proposed changes from ES6, ES7, etc... available for use today!

It has optional typing annotations so you can make the TypeScript compiler
type-check your code and find bugs for you. It works well with the existing JS
ecosystem. It's so good, that's irresponsible not to use it.

TypeScript was originally built by Microsoft to help their teams make sense of
large JavaScript codebases, but it's no longer a one-company-pet-project. It's
used and developed by many people across many organizations. It's the language
that's being used by Google's team behind Angular2. It's the language that has
been used at Facebook to specify the ImmutableJS API.

Let's get to know TypeScript, its differences from plain JavaScript, its
mighty advantages and why it can give you the piece of mind of strongly-typed
languages while still letting you have all the advantages of JavaScript's
flexibility.
