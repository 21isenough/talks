Description
-----------

React is a performant UI framework loved by many but, in order to take your apps performance to a native like level, you have to know how to take advantage of all its capabilities and go deep in React’s inner workings. 

In this talk I'm going to tell the challenges that we (at OutSystems) faced while developing the new version of our product to deliver faster and optimized mobile apps.
Expect to see the highlights of this 2-year journey and leave with some takeaways:
- how does React work (quick overview)
- how to improve React app's performance (the quest for the 100ms response)
- prevent some performance problems (eg: layout trashing)
- how to deal with very complex UIs (hint: virtualization)
- improving css animations and transitions

I am passionate about technology and love Software development.
I enjoy spending some of my spare time working on software projects and exploring and learning state-of-the-art technologies. 
When I'm not in front of a computer screen I like to drive, travel and record videos with my quadcopter.

I work at OutSystems for more than 7 years where I play a key role in the development and architectural design of the OutSystems Platform.

Furthermore, I am a Computer Engineering MSc graduate at Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal) where I specialized in Distributed Systems and Software Engineering.
