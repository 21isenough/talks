Description
-----------

Another talk about dos and dont’s of Microservices.
Having a REST API is not the same thing of having a Microservice.
A Microservice can scale, be distributed and needs to handle several types of problems only distributed systems have, behaving like a cluster and with the need to be aware of the state of it’s resources.

So I propose a practical view showing how to make the most of existing frameworks and providing at the end with the source code for the demo for those eager to try new things.

Overview:
* Setting up a Jetty/Jersey server;
* Database access made easy (Yank/DbUtils/HikariCP);
* Using Swagger to generate clients easily;
* Converting a simple REST API into a Microservices distributed system (Hazelcast);
* Adding a cache layer (Google Guava/Hazelcast);
* Circuit breakers and resource management;
* Distributed processing and redundancy;
