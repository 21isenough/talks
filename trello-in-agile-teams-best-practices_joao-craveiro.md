Description
-----------

Trello is a very flexible productivity tool, with a wide range of application scenarios. In agile software development, small to medium projects can surely benefit from its simplicity (compared to more fully-featured --- and expensive --- tools). This talk is about the three main building blocks of a Trello board: labels, lists, and checklists. They're so simple, and yet so easy to get wrong in ways you may regret halfway through --- if you don't know some details about how these three elements work in Trello. I do not intend to prescribe a given way to organize your backlog/sprints/Kanban/whatever in a Trello board: in the end, you'll have my personal recipe for Trello-supported agile development with a good balance between the typical project management needs and not imposing too much overhead on development team members.

Speaker Bio
-----------

I am a software engineer turned pro??ct manager at Premium Minds. I've joined Premium Minds in 2014, developing J2EE-based backend solutions, and I've gradually embraced agile project/product management duties. I like to think of myself as a product-inclined software engineer turned into a development-conscious project/product manager.

Before that? Well, a lot. From old to new, I've worked at a computer store, done web development, blogged, written tech pieces for a newspaper supplement, researched on embedded and real-time systems, wrote two theses and over a dozen papers, and taught subjects such as embedded systems, operating systems, computer architecture, computer networks and object-oriented programming.
