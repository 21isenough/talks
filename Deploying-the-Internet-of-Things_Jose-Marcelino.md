Description
-----------
For a long time sitting in the "Peak of Inflated Expectations", and "death by a thousand prototypes" the Internet of Things (IoT) is finally coming out strong with real, mass-market, solutions. 
This year is already proving to be game changing with key players like Alibaba setting targets of 1 Billion connected devices.

In this talk we explore the motivations driving the IoT, the current directions and take a twist into what can we learn from biology to inform its path.
 
We'll then look at practical use cases highlighting how the combination of accessible widespread connectivity, low power and the concept of Systems Flexibility - where the IoT stack is flexible - presents new opportunities and insights from everyday things.
