According to [JS Frameworks Benchmark](http://www.stefankrause.net/js-frameworks-benchmark5/webdriver-ts/table.html) it is one of the JavaScript frameworks with better performance.

We will review the core concepts of the framework, and demonstrate how you can scale progressively, even when you have complex requirements.
