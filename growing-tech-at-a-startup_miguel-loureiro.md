Speaker Bio
-----------
My name is Miguel Loureiro and I'm Director of Technology at Uniplaces. I've been working in all areas of our product and started as a developer two years ago. Working as full stack developer and also being in charge of the infrastructure of the whole product I can say it has been a long, hardworking, but pleasant and enriching journey. Previously, I've worked at smaller companies taking ownership of the majority of the projects I was assigned to.

I like sports (football and combat), I blog, I like to read, and mostly, I like to share knowledge.
