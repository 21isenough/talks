Description
-----------

We live in a Data-centric era. Nowadays we have at our disposal an enormous variety of services using data. Behind those services there are architectures supporting the flowing and processing of that data. BinaryEdge.io is no exception. Supporting our platform, we have a data architecture processing 1000s of events per second, which was built and is currently maintained by us.

In this talk we are going to review the parts that compose a data architecture, and discuss which tools can be used at each step to arrive at a functional architecture. Note that the insights given will not be based of theoretical documents or truckloads of years of experience, but on our own experience of building and maintaining a large scale data infrastructure and architecture.

Speaker Bio

I work at BinaryEdge.io as a Data Engineer/Platform Developer. I was hired to chew bubblegum and wreck havoc... and I'm all out of bubblegum. I like coding, I enjoy Artificial Intelligence and Data Science topics, but mostly I love to learn new things.
