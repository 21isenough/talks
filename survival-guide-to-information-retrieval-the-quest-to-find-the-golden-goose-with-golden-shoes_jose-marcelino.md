Description
-----------


Being every tiny search box lays a piece of complex engineering routines powered by a hidden field of science, Information Retrieval. Ingenious algorithms define the way we find what we are looking for uppon search, in the vast pool of documents stored. 

What happens when I type in the search box? 
This talk will guide us through a typical query journey. We will give an overview of the field of Information Retrieval, from the historical roots to more recent approaches. We will explain the problems and motivate our quest in finding the golden goose with golden shoes. A path full of misspellings, acronyms and out of domain words. This study resulted in Semantic Search (also presented as a scientific publication on the AI for fashion workshop at KDD 2018¹) a key part of Farfetch's search engine, responsible for query understanding.
