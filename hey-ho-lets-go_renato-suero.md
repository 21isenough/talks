Description
-----------

An introduction to GO, a language created by google. We’ll start by looking at the basic structure of code in GO, its packages. After that we’ll go through conditional structures and repetitions, collections, structs, functions, methods and interfaces. Finally we’ll check concurrency, tests and the gometalinter package, which helps producing high quality code.  
This talk is mainly intended for programmers who have only basic or even no knowledge of the language at all. The goal is to get people know the language and to help figure out where and when they can use GO.
