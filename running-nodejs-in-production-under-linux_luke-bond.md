Running Node.js in Production using systemd
===========================================

* Speaker   : Luke Bond
* Length    : 25mins talking, not including questions.
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

In the Node.js world it is common to employ process monitors such as forever, PM2 and nodemon. Whilst these are excellent tools, Linux, the operating system we're all running in production, already has the ultimate process manager: the init system.

In this talk I'll show developers how easy it is to configure systemd to run your Node.js apps and handle process monitoring, logging and clustering. These tools are mature, proven and very powerful, as Linux sysadmins use them everyday to manage services.

The talk will be demo-heavy, demonstrating just how easy it is to do all of this yourself from scratch.

I am a back-end developer working at YLD.io, a London-based software engineering consultancy, working mostly with Node.js and Docker.
I built an open-source container-based PaaS called Paz (http://paz.sh) in Node.js, CoreOS and Docker.
I have spoken at NodeConf, CoreOSFest and ContainerCamp as well as meetups in London and Lisbon.
I have spent the last few years moving further down the stack, from application developer to containers, Linux and deployment.
