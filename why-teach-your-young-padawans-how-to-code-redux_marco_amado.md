Description
-----------

This will be an expansion of a previosly lightning talk given at Codebits 2014, with the same name.

It'll have two parts:

1. Why should *everyone*, and particularly children, learn how to code, or at least understand some of it's concepts?
    * Will future automatons (from house ligths to self-driving cars) be able to understand natural language and the intricacies of human intents beyond simple and clear commands, let alone emotional decisions?
    * Will there be jobs for humans on the not-so-far future? What kind of jobs? You may want to think this one through...
2. What is currently being done about it and what can we teach our younglings?
    * Projects that are currently teaching code to children or training educators to teach code for free or close;
    * How to teach code to children (highly IMHO-ridden matter, although an informed opinion, to say the least)


Speaker Bio
-----------

I've been a professional developer for ten years now, ranging from web (both frontend and backend) to desktop and mobile applications.

I have two daughters, aged 12 and 5, and that pretty much qualifies me to give this talk; or to give Zen workshops; or the "Top ten reasons why Frozen is much deeper than it seems on the surface" talk. You pick.

I started learning code at age 6, more than 30 years ago, in an age before internet was a thing. That also gave me a concrete and first-hand insight into this theme, given that I had to start pretty much alone and with nowhere to go when things went south.
