Description
-----------

Servers are killing your productivity. Rather than building better software for your users, you end up constantly distracted by maintaining computers. Wasn't the "cloud" supposed to fix this? It sounded so promising until we realised it was just renting VMs in someone else's datacenter. We couldn't escape "servers". Until now...

In this session, developers will learn how to build microservices without servers, using modern “serverless” cloud platforms. We’ll look at common challenges (and solutions) to building applications using “serverless” stacks. Exploring emerging “serverless” design patterns will give developers the knowledge to build application architectures using these new platforms.

This session is aimed at software developers experienced in building traditional backend web applications, who want to learn how to build microservices managing infrastructure.

I'm an [experienced conference speaker](http://lanyrd.com/profile/thomasj/past/speaking/), have spoken at over twenty conferences since 2011.
Since 2016, I've been regularly [speaking](regularly), [blogging](http://jamesthom.as/blog/categories/serverless/) and [creating open-source](https://github.com/jthomas) about building applications using serverless cloud platforms.
I'm involved in an open-source serverless platform, [Apache OpenWhisk](http://openwhisk.incubator.apache.org/), as the maintainer for the [JavaScript client library](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-client-js) and [Serverless Framework provider plugin](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-openwhisk).

Serverless platforms will become the default environment for cloud applications [in the next few years](https://hackernoon.com/why-the-fuss-about-serverless-4370b1596da0).
