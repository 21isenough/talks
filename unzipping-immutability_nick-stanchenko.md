Unzipping Immutability
========================

* Speaker   : Nick Stanchenko
* Length    : 30–40 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

At Feedzai we make an extensive use of immutability to ensure correctness and avoid concurrency pitfalls
in one of the domains where it’s most valueable: risk scoring of financial transactions.

If you have ever wondered what’s the buzz about immutable data structures and how they can be implemented and used sensibly,
this talk is for you!

We’ll take advantage of interactive visualizations and see several immutable data structures in action.
Having surfaced immutability’s crucial tricks, we’ll move our focus to lens and zippers —
handy tools that combine the convenience of the “mutable world” with the expressiveness of functional programming.

Note: although the Scala language will be used as the vehicle for illustrating concepts in this talk,
absolutely no prior knowledge of Scala is required.
However Scala programmers might additionally benefit from some practical approaches presented.
