Description
-----------

It's starting to become common knowledge that Microservices approach to systems architecture is the way to go. This is insanely dangerous and most of the times you're actually much better served with a glorified and well structured monolith instead. In this talk I'll try to bring some sense to the microservices craze by killing some myths around Monoliths, exposing the hardships of a Microservices oriented architecture and providing some tips on when should you start _thinking_ about breaking your monolith up. Microservices bandwagon party goers, let's talk for a few minutes.

I'm a technology enthusiast, soon to be father and difficult problems lover. Go to language lays between Elixir and Ruby for the backend, and React and... well... good old vanilla JS, for the frontend. Currently tackling challenges on Talkdesk for almost 5 years where I helped both growing the engineering team from 5 to 100 and scaling our services to handle the growth of the company. Love to talk about stuff, don't be a stranger!:D
