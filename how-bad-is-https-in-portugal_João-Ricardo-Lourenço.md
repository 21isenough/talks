Description
-----------

There have been numerous exploits and attacks on HTTPS in recent years. HTTPS is (erroneously) heralded by many as the "one size fits all" solution for encryption and privacy on the internet, yet one can be surprised at how often it is misused. Moxie Marlinspike has developed several (somewhat) "easy to use tools" that allow attackers to sniff HTTPS traffic in different ways. There are solutions to these attacks, but the question remains: how often and how well are they employed?

Together with a friend, **we conducted research on the list of Portugal's 50 most visited web sites, as well as some critical websites (such as those of banks or financial institutions) to evaluate just how bad HTTPS is in Portugal**. We wanted to know how easy it was to extract personal data (think usernames and passwords) from these websites. The results surprised us, and they might surprise you too. This is not a talk filled with new ideas and concepts, although the attacks and techniques used are described in detail. The goal of this talk is to shed light on bad security practices being used in _Your Next Favorite Website_ (or, more importantly, your non-tech-savvy dad's _Next Favorite Website_), helping you understand how you can prevent your _(dad's)_ traffic from being sniffed, or how you can improve your next website. You would think most of this talk would be elementary -- so did we, but that didn't stop these websites from being highly vulnerable.

Speaker Bio
-----------

My name is João Ricardo Lourenço and I'm 23 years old. I finished my BSc in Computer Science ("Engenharia Informática") in 2014 and finished my MSc in Computer Science this year (2016), both in the University of Coimbra. My thesis involved the proposal, implementation and validation of a new preventive exception handling model, and was graded 20/20. I have been working as a researcher for the University of Coimbra (as a member of CISUC - Center for Informatics and Systems of the University of Coimbra) since 2012, having published several papers in the area of NoSQL databases and exception handling. I have also been an invited assistant teacher for the "Acertar o Rumo" programme for two years, where I tutored several students in basic programming skills and advanced Java Enterprise topics such as JPA, EJBs or JSF. I've been awarded several prizes and scolarships throughout my academic career.

My interests are varied and, at times, a bit eccentric. I love working with low-level programming, and have had several "personal operating systems from scratch" projects. I want to know everything I can about compilers, standard libraries, distributed systems, kernel development -- basically whatever allows me to understand the most about whatever is going on in these magical machines. My "impossible" dream is to one day browse the internet in my own web browser, in my own operating system written in my own language running on my own CPU architecture -- because why the heck not? This does not mean that I don't also like to look at things from "the big picture" and work from a more high-level architectural perspective on new software. I'm not a big fan of frontend work, though.

I originally started my masters in the area of "Intelligent Systems", working with evolutionary computation and data mining topics, although I eventually decided to "mix things up" with topics from "Software Engineering". I enjoy coding as much as I can (and, although my Github profile lacks much activity, you can somewhar get that just by looking through it). I was one of the leading developers of the "Inforestudante Mobile" official application for the University of Coimbra (a project we developed during one semester). Often, I distract myself by getting obsessed with a new topic and trying (and failing in comedic fashion) to learn all I can about it. I guess I'm just mad about everything computer science related. I started coding in C++ a long time ago, but I must admit that modern C++ is not anywhere near what it was when I started learning -- nowadays I code in whatever is needed, but mostly Java or Python. Have I mentioned I love Python? Yeah, I love Python.

All in all, I just want to have fun and share whatever knowledge I can. Computer Science is fun. Computers are fun. Programming languages are fun. Making software is fun! :)
