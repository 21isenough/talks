Description

Getting close to its 12th anniversary, nginx is now one the most popular web servers around, especially in high-volume websites. Yes, Netcraft confirms it: Apache is dying.

For the past 13 years I've been a systems administrator and a software developer, both in the academic and corporate worlds, working with proprietary and open-source technologies on meaningless and critical systems (and applications) with various degrees of complexity and scale. I've run with scissors and broken things in production.
