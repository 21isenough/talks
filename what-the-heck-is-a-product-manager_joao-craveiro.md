Description
-----------

Product Manager: one of the least defined roles in the computer industry. No two companies have the same description for this job title, and it can even vary widely within one company. Is this the CEO of the product (bleargh!)? Is this a project manager wearing sneakers and hipster glasses? Do we really need them? Is this a business, marketing or technology role? Is this someone with a degree in engineering, or an MBA? What can make a software engineer want to become a product manager?

This talk is for anyone who works with a product manager (if you're here, you most likely will at some point). It is also for anyone with some other type of curiosity about the role. Do you (think you) want to be a product manager? Are you a product manager confused about your own role (don't worry, we've all been there)?

Don't expect leaving with one answer, because there isn't one. But you'll take home enough new insights to be able to better understand the role — either to work better with the product managers in your organisation, or to decide whether this as a career path you want to pursue.

Speaker Bio
-----------

I love solving real problems of real people using computer technology as a means to it — be it by coding, by gathering requirements, by managing a project, by helping other people be more efficient, or by simply spreading knowledge.

I'm currently a Product Manager at Onfido, a London-based startup delivering next-generation identity verification and background checks, helping businesses across the world verify anyone, anywhere.

Before that, I was a Product Manager at Premium Minds, a Lisbon-based software development agency (where I've also been through the duties of software engineer and agile coach) and professor at Universidade Lusófona. Even before that? Well, a lot. From old to new, I've worked at a computer store, done web development, written tech pieces for a newspaper supplement, researched on embedded and real-time systems, wrote two theses and over a dozen papers, and been a teaching assistant at U. Lisbon for embedded systems, operating systems, computer architecture, and object-oriented programming courses.
