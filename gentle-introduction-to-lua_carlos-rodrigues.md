A Gentle Introduction to Lua
============================

* Speaker   : Carlos Rodrigues
* Length    : 45 minutes
* Language  : Portuguese

Description
-----------

Lua is probably one of the most underrated programming languages. It accomplishes the rather curious combination of being both widely used throughout the industry and pratically unknown by most people. Its lightweight runtime and no-nonsense syntax makes it very interesting for embedded scripting and today you can find in places such as game engines, NoSQL databases (eg. Redis) or web servers (eg. nginx).

The purpose of this talk is to give a quick - but hopefully useful - taste of the language for busy geeks.

For the past 13 years I've been a systems administrator and a software developer, both in the academic and corporate worlds, working with proprietary and open-source technologies on meaningless and critical systems (and applications) with various degrees of complexity and scale. I've run with scissors and broken things in production.
