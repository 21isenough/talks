Programming enthusiast since 2004, when I build my first Javascript application to prompt the user’s name and to show: “Hello “+name, and since then I turned such hobby as my main professional area. I am passionate about working with server-side Javascript apps, with Node.JS. However at the moment I am looking for an Angular.JS role. I want to become an Angular expert, also get more knowledge about E2E and Unit testing. Recently I have been working on hybrid mobile applications using Javascript and HTML 5 for the biggest bank in the Netherlands.
