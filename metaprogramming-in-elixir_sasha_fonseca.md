Metaprogramming with Elixir
========================

Description
-----------
Metaprogramming is the coding of programs that consume other programs as their input data. These meta-programs can evaluate and transform their input in order to create new programs or modify existing ones. This programming paradigm can bring benefits to a programmer's productivity and his software's qualities by allowing the removal of *boilerplate* code, creating Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) or by building more expressive languages and APIs. 

In the Elixir ecosystem, extremely successful projects --- like [Ecto](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto), the [Phoenix Framework](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) and the [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir) language itself --- resort to the use of metaprogramming in order to boost their software's quality attributes. The language provides robust mechanisms for metaprogramming allowing a programmer to write less code while getting more work done.

In this talk I will give an introduction to metaprogramming with Elixir, demystify some concepts about this programming paradigm and show how you can benefit from it through a series of simple examples in successful projects. These examples will be:
- The removal of boilerplate code
- Creating a Software Product Line through code injection 
- How to expand the Elixir language via metaprogramming (live example) 

Prior knowledge of Elixir is not required for this talk.

I'm an Italian-Portuguese Software Developer (wanna be Engineer) who loves to build new concepts and things while always grounding my creations in Computer Science and academia. I strongly believe the software industry and academia have become too further apart and I'm on a mission to marry them!

Lately I've been greatly tangled in the Elixir and Erlang ecosystem (I'm part of the staff of the official [Elixir Forum](http://elixirforum.com)) and have been doing my best to spread the word about it here in Lisbon. Other interests of mine have been Software Architecture, Cloud Computing and parallel and concurrent programming. Also I'm finishing my Master's this year while working at S21sec.

Outside of software development I'm a music aficionado (specially by Progressive Music) and weightlifting enthusiast. If you wanna discuss music or lift some weights please holla at me anytime!
