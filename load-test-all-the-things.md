Description
-----------

Not all applications are born the same: some are subject to high load, others will be hit with a couple of requests every once in a while; some will be fed with loads and loads of data, others will deal with a couple of MBytes from time to time; some are built with performance as a non-functional requirement, other are "just made to work".

Either way, it's important to be able to assess how the application will behave under heavy load in terms of high number of requests and/or high data load.

This will be a hands-on session where we will explore some load testing tools, learn how to build a simple yet effective Load Test Plan and analyse a bit through the results.
