Description
-----------

Ever wondered how companies that handle large amounts of data deal with inclusion tests? How Medium and Quora know what you have read without even querying the database? How Facebook does type-ahead queries? Or how databases optimize disk lookup? It's nothing new. Actually, it's a very, very old trick - almost 50 years old. And it's called Bloom Filter.

This talk will cover the basics behind bloom filters. It will explain why such an ancient, unconventional data structure is so widely used, especially when performance and space-efficiency is required. We will go on a journey through bloom filter land, analysing their behaviour, how different properties affect their internal performance and how you can improve your application by using a bloom filter.

Speaker Bio

I'm a university student currently finishing my master's degree in Distributed Systems and Cryptography. My main passion is Open Source and for the past couple of years I have been giving talks and workshops in several university events and developer meetups.

I've been deeply involved in organising several student conferences, such as SEI - Semana da Engenharia Inform√°tica, and Heartbits - the first student medtech hackathon in Portugal. I'm also currently one of the organisers of Coderdojo Minho.

I'm not the host of the portuguese version of The Price Is Right but yes, I'd love to sign your t-shirt!
