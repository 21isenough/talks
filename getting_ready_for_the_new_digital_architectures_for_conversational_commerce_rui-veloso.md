Description
-----------
Chriss Messina from Uber coined the term conversational commerce in 2015 to describe the intersection between app messaging and commerce. Funny stories are happening with bots when applied to business concerning maturity, security and misunderstandings.
 
Besides funny stories, real examples of bots applied to commerce are here. Wechat is a messaging platform from China with 700 million monthly users and it already provides ways of getting a taxi, order food, buy tickets, all by chatting! Facebook, Amazon and a lot of startups are all getting into this movement.
 
On commerce we want to provide new experiences, new journeys to the consumer to be able to buy products, like ordering a pizza on a bus with WhattsApp or to be able to get advice on the best TV with Facebook.
 
There will be strong impacts on digital architectures. Some say UI will lose importance. I imagine a new “UI” being the style, the mood and the character of the conversation. 
 
Leveraging capacities like asynchronous messaging services and machine learning the new architectures will also foster already existing ones for commerce, like search, recommendation and personalization engines, context aware and next best actions predictive models.
 
Conversations will allow a much richer extraction of knowledge from the customer, his references and affinities. Bots will become influential agents, story tellers, that help us to buy something and to keep buying on the long term. Bots will be the “seek and convert” agents for the commerce arena.
 
Decision trees will be scripted in ways of a “natural” and more human conversation. Bots will become multi domain experts and concierges. Because of that the new consumer journeys will be reshaped. 
 
Some say 2016 is the year of conversational commerce – I think it is now more than a buzz and inflated expectations! And a new perspective on the supporting digital architecture is emerging – let us share some thoughts.
