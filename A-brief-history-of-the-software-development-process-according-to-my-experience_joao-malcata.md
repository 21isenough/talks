A brief history of the software development process according to my experience
========================

* Speaker: Joao Malcata
* Available: Thursday or Friday
* Length: 30 mins
* Language: English (or Portuguese)

Description
-----------
Over almost 20 years, I have been involved in a multitude of software development endeavors. Out of sheer luck or just time passing, together they seem to show an “evolution“ worth sharing. Even if not systematic and according to a scientific process, experience does provide insight and I hope lessons to be learned.

By the end of the session, you will be able to give some meaning to:
1. where do you stand, as far as, the development process is concerned 
2. what you feel would be the optimal scenario to unlock your potential
