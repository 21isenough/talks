Description
-----------
The wave of using messaging apps as interfaces for all kinds of services started in China with WeChat and has rapidly become a new global reality. You can now order a pizza, buy products or book a flight chatting with a service on Facebook Messenger. The conversation may happen with a bot, a real human or a mix of both. The challenge is that the conversation is seamless no matter what language the user speaks.

Unbabel’s API makes this reality possible by combining a crowd of human translators, distributed worldwide, with Artificial Intelligence technology. The result is human quality translations

This session will show how in a few minutes you can enable multilingual conversations.
