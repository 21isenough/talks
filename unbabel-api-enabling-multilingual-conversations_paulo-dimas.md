Description
-----------
The wave of messaging apps as interfaces for all kinds of services started in China with WeChat and has rapidly become a new global reality. You can now order a pizza, buy products or book a flight chatting on Facebook Messenger. The conversation may happen with a bot, a real human or a mix of both. The challenge is that no matter what language is spoken by the user the conversation is seamless.

The Unbabel API makes this reality possible giving access to a crowd of human translators, distributed worldwide, empowered with Artificial Intelligence technology. The result are human quality translations that make chat conversations flow naturally in more than 20 languages. This session will show how you can make this possible with a few lines of code.
