Description
-----------

This is a talk about Futurology. Why it is important to understand the study of the futures, where did Futurology came from and why it won't matter anymore after 2053.

I will introduce you to what I believe to be the most important concepts to grasp about Futurology and you will understand why all the corporates are going crazy about innovation and open innovation.

The talk will also touch base with some of the amazing changes happening in our world today and how will they impact our tech future.

So if innovation is important to you, you have a tech startup or you just want to change the world with technology came and discuss the future with us.

P.s.: I would love to close with an example of the main lines you should follow to make Innovation a process with stable results but probably won't have time. If this is important to you let me know and I'll try to adapt :)

At 16 I created the 1st online radio in Portugal. It mainly streamed live online games and quickly went from uncapping coaxial modems to a sponsorship from the national telecom operator.

I started my first company at 18 and went from IT to being the main supplier of criminal investigation equipment in Portugal while also launching a University National Engineering Competiton that nowadays happens in 30 countries.

In 2011 I became the youngest Sales Responsible for a multinational working in homeland security and soon after that, my startup developed and launched the world smallest 4G HD video server.

Mostly work in Innovation and Strategy, helping startups and big corporates like Vodafone, Auchan or Leroy Merlin. Always looking for new challenges and opportunities, especially if they involve connected hardware :)
