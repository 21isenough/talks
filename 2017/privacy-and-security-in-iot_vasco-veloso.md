After 20+ years writing software, I'm currently working at Coriant Portugal as a Software Architect who still 
keeps his hands dirty designing and writing Java code for a distributed optical network management system. 

Curious about hardware design, the IoT and how it will affect how we go about our everyday lives. I built and
programmed embedded systems for a living for some time last century, which got me started on IoT this century.

Interested in design methodologies and distributed systems.
