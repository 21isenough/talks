Quest of Dungeons started as a mobile game to be played in quick sessions, but eventually made it's way to Steam and finally consoles.

The game was ported to 10 different platforms, this session will take you through the process, from the original idea up to the latest Nintendo Switch version. It covers some of the core porting challenges: the custom engine powering all the game, maintaining abstraction across platforms, UI and input challenges from the different versions.

Hey, I'm David, a indie game developer, I've been coding for over 10 years now, 7 of which mostly dedicated to game development.

I started to play games as soon as I had access to a console and became fascinated by it. After some years of just unfinished projects I decided to complete and publish my first indie game in 2010. Among other titles I worked on Vizati, Puwang and most recently Quest of Dungeons, the game that got more attention and eventually let me to create my one man studio, Upfall Studios.
