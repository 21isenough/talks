If it takes minutes to code a bot, building professional bots represents quite a challenge. Soon you realize you need serious programming and API architecture experience but also “Bot” specific skills. In this session, we'll first show the basics to build a Chat Bot. We'll then explore the challenges faced when creating more advanced Bots: persisting user contexts, interfacing with NLP technologies, adding Bot Metadata, controlling OAuth scopes at the enterprise level... Finally, we'll discuss interesting opportunities from latest industry trends: embedding Calls and Video, connecting with Real World events & IoT devices...

This talk is about showing the code and sharing lessons learnt.
