Description
-----------

The cradle of Agile Methodologies started in the beginning of the 1990’s, still to these days and although they have spread through a lot of companies, the mentalities are still from the industrial era.

As programmers, product owners, project managers…whatever is your role on the IT industry, one of the main issues is to grow a true team - as a group of people is not a team.

Using Kamasutra metaphors, Nuno and David will make a parallelism between how you should engage with your team like you should do with your sexual partner. Create a healthy, trustful and lost lasting relationship and you reach agile nirvana.

“Sex is part of human nature. Agile is part of teams nature.”

The goal of this talk is for everyone to get back to their teams and help them excel in delivering more value for the clients, the team members and yourself!
