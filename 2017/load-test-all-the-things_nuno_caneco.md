* Language  : English

Description
-----------

Not all applications are born the same: some are subject to high load, others will be hit by a couple of requests every once in a while; some will be fed with loads and loads of data, others will deal with a couple of MBytes from time to time; some are built with performance as a non-functional requirement, other are "just made to work".

Either way, as a developer, it's important to know how to find performance issues on an application under heavy load while also getting to know the factors that are a constraint to the performance like a database or some library in use.

In this session, we'll be submitting a web application to a load test and learn a few tricks on how to improve it's performance.
