Exploiting Cryptographic Vulnerabilities in Real World Applications
========================

* Language  : English

Description
-----------

We use cryptography every day, whether we're aware of it or not. The green padlock on the top left corner of our
browser window gives us a feeling of trust and comfort... but what happens when we take crypto into our own hands
and try to solve every problem with it? This talk is an exposée of applications vulnerable to cryptographic 
vulnerabilities that I have found while working as a penetration tester and application security analyst. 
From decrypting credit card numbers to breaking passwords, I will show you how I performed basic cryptanalysis
to find weaknesses in these schemes and exploit them for fun and profit.
