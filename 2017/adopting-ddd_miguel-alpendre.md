Description
-----------

Bureaucracy, unclarity and technical debt are just some of many obstacles teams face when making product development. Developers need to be challenged to solve real problems, that’s how we are motivated.

Domain-driven design is a philosophy described by Eric Evans that tackles those concerns effectively and helps to engage team members at their full capabilities. By defining domain models that project realities in bounded contexts, developers can elaborate clear perceptions of the business. Therefore, domain problems are identified in advance and real value is added to the product.

It’s been an amazing journey since we adopted DDD, almost one year ago. I will talk about its inner concepts, our progress as a team and what we plan to achieve.
