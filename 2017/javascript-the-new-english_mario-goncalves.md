Javascript: The new English
========================

* Speaker   : [Mário Gonçalves](https://pixels.camp/mariomc)
* Length    : 30 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

Even though it seems like **Javascript** *"is eating the World"*, it is **not** exactly so. In fact, this exact same pattern of growth, use and expansion was found in the history of today's *lingua franca*: **English**

This talk will draw a parallel between a natural language and a programming language, comparing their syntax and evolution, unveiling oddities and similarities as well as touch the advantages - and common pitfalls - of having a cross-boundary language in this increasingly small and diverse world.

I'm Mário, a geek and developer who likes to learn, think, help and create.

The Web is my playground and the front-end tech has my favorite toys.

I also like to keep my thinking blade sharp and one of the most efficient ways to do that is to surround myself by the best and, since 2008, I've been fortunate to work with just those at Sky, E.Near, SAPO, ROFF, Kriação, Talent and CCL.

If I'm not exercising my *engineering no jutsu*, catch me up for a game of Magic: The Gathering.
