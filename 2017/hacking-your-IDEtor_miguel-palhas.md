# Hacking your IDEtor

* Speaker   : *Miguel Palhas*
* Length    : *30-45 mins*
* Language  : *English*

## Description

After my talk last year, "Mastering your Tools", I'm back at the subject of more millisecond-shaving tips for your code-writing pleasure.

This time, I'll focus on one particular tool: the text editor. For me that's Neovim, for you, it might be Visual Studio, or even _aaargh_ Emacs. But who cares?

My goal for the past few months is to do as little of my job as possible.

My job is to write code. And I want to write less of it, and also spend less time writing it.

So I'm focusing on having my editor do the heavy lifting for me. And that covers a wide range of topics:

- seamless navigation within a codebase (often within multiple languages)
- dynamic and contextual snippets
- auto-generated boilerplate code
- strongly typed vs weakly typed languages
- ...
- cool sh*t your text editor can't event do, but you wish it could

In this talk I'll go through various methodologies, tips, plugins, and shortcuts, that I use during the day to be able to increase my output.

## Speaker Bio

**Miguel Palhas**

I've been working on the web For the past four years, mostly writing Ruby, but also some awesome web animation on the side.
I have a passion for Open-source, and for giving back to the community. I've taught programming to hundreds of people (between meetups, university courses, 1-1 mentoring, and even our own coding school), and have helped organize several meetups and development conferences (most notably RubyConf Portugal).
When I'm not busy building high-quality web code, or bothering others with my teachings, I might still be busy trying to become a real game developer. Being an astronaut is no longer an option, so that's the one childhood dream I still have going on.
