We have entered a moment of punctuated change for technology interfaces. What interfaces will look like at the end we do not know. Access to rich, personal, and real-time data available on mobile devices, combined with the persistent connection to the interface afforded by notifications, watches, and smart speakers have necessitated a new way to think about the interfaces.

Here, we'll explore how data and machine learning can be used to understand what a user is doing and anticipate what they want or when they need technology. We'll be starting with real world examples and results and ending in the future of [Neuralink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink) and what is possible.

I am the co-founder of Set, where we are trying to help technology better understand humans. We believe that the future of user-experience can be improved by building technology that uses data to understand what we want and need before interaction. [Set](http://set.gl) bridges that gap by creating on-device algorithms for analyzing streaming personal data to help instruct apps and services to provide greater value throughout our day.

I wear a lot of hats, sometimes a coder and sometimes a data scientist.

I previously ran Research and Community teams at [Carto](http://carto.com) in NYC. I also taught a course at NYU's ITP called, _Maps, Lies, and Storytelling_.

Before that I got my PhD studying biodiversity and my Masters studying viruses.
