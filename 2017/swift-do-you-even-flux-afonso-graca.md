Description

**"Which architecture is the best and why should you been using it"** is a never-ending debate in the *iOS* community. However, independently of the architecture you end up choosing, most apps don't have a defined pattern for state management. As apps grow and get more complex, this is usually a source of some bad experiences.

In 2014, *Facebook* brought us *Flux* and with it, the idea of unidirectional data flow. Allied with *React*, *Flux* and its variations took the Web World by storm. Today's mobile apps also rely heavily on data handling so why not apply the same principles to it?

This talk is aimed at the mobile community, specifically the iOS community. It is supposed to be an intro to the unidirectional data flow pattern, cover the basics of how to use *Flux* and *Redux* on *iOS* and share my experience in applying it to existing code, its benefits and pitfalls.

I'm Afonso Graça, I've been a software developer for the past 5 years, mainly doing iOS and web development. When Swift was first announced I was sold and for the better part of the last 2 years, I've been using it everyday. I'm a huge fan of OSS and contribute whenever I can, which unfortunately is not as frequently as I'd like it to be. 

Speaking-wise, this is roughly how I'm like:
