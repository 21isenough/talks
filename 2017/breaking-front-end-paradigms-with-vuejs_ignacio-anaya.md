According to [JS Frameworks Benchmark](http://www.stefankrause.net/js-frameworks-benchmark5/webdriver-ts/table.html), it is one of the JavaScript frameworks with better performance. Vue.js is the future of the client-side MV* world, and is one of the most promising alternatives, competing with industry giants frameworks, such as React and Angular 2. We will review the core concepts of the framework, and demonstrate how you can scale progressively, even when you have complex requirements.
