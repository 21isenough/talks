Docker Compose for fearless developers
========================

* Speaker   : [João Bolila](https://pixels.camp/jbolila)
* Length    : 30min
* Language  : Portuguese

Description
-----------

In this talk I'll guide the build of a development environment for an application with separate
containers, connected towards a reproducible end trusted environment from development to production.

For this I'll be using a web application with three containers, a frontend running Nginx,
a Swagger API on NodeJS and a database (PostgreSQL or ElasticSearch).

Let's improve our relation with devOps team for good!

I'm a developer, not a system programmer, not a web developer, something in between where I can stress the concurrency of one the get the best of the other. Each day more into API development using NodeJS, and talking some other languages like Python, Rust and Perl .. for fun and profit.
