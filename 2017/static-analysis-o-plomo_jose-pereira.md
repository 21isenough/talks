Static Analysis o Plomo?
===================================

Description
-----------

Have you considered auditing your source code using static analysis tools? What do these things pick up that you can't with a code review? How do they work?

Software security concerns have fortunately been increasing over the last few years, certainly due to the continuous growing number of threats being thrown at our applications every day. Still, not every project's contributor is a software security expert and hiring one to perform thorough code reviews for each contribution can be unsustainable.

This is where SAST (Static Application Security Testing) comes in. These tools rely on static source code analysis to parse and query abstract syntax trees, or parse trees, inferring potential vulnerabilities without having a running system. The basic components of these tools will be discussed as well as their pros and cons.
