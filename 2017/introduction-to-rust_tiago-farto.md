* Length    : *1800 seconds*

Description
-----------

Rust is awesome, and if you're coding you should (probably) learn it. Rust can be as powerful as C, and as safe as... stuff. I like rust, and so should you!
I'll try to give a short introduction to rust, explain why I like it, and how I started learning it. My idea is to write something a little bit more complex than an hello world, maybe fill some structs, save a file or something, link some external code... live coding, like people do now on the internet, but LIVEEEEEEEEEEEEE in flesh and bones (mostly skin, though)!

Isn't this written elsewhere? I'm an experienced programmer, used to do the worse possible code in every kind of language, and now I've started learning rust. I'm probably not the best person to do a talk about rust, but someone has to.
