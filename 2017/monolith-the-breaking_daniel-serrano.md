# Monolith: The Breaking

- _Speaker_: [Daniel Serrano](https://pixels.camp/dnlserrano)
- _Length_: 30-45 minutes
- _Language_: English

## Description

Startups often start out by developing MVPs that fit all needs of their product offering. Billing, user management, invoicing, etc. It's all crammed up in the same place. The so called _monolith_. This can lead to various problems: running the deployment pipeline now takes ages, that flaky test you didn't write is breaking and it is now your responsibility to fix it, you're dependent on deploy times of other teams to release your feature, etc.

In this talk, I'm going to try and convince you on why you should embrace a microservices-oriented architecture and how you can effectively achieve a successful transition. It will be based on a real-life scenario of extracting two microservices out of an existing monolith. By the end of this talk, you'll hopefully have an idea about why the following are important, and what role each of these play in this process of breaking the monolith:

- Setting up fallbacks
- Using circuit breaking mechanisms
- Collecting metrics
- Paranoid monitoring
- Incremental rollout
- Keeping feature pairity

I will also talk about alternatives to what we ended up deciding upon when doing the split. We will talk about what still is to be done and the next steps to achieve it.
