Description
-----------

So you've been tasked with the development of your company's new mobile app, which has to be the bee's knees as a major requirement: it has to use GPS, the camera, push notifications, them sweet, sweet 60FPS animations and all those other native doo-dads that must make your users overjoyed with delight. The only problem? You have a small team, limited resources, a multiplatform requirement and a veeeery limited timeframe. Oh, and not everyone on the team has mobile experience. Abandon ship, right?

Enter React Native, the new kid on the block. Built by the giant Facebook, it's the little mobile development framework that could replace all other approaches to mobile development in our near future! Join us as we find out if it really can or not in our little talk, as we go over the small history of React Native, where it comes from, how native it is, where it wants to go to, where React fits in and, perhaps most importantly, what you can do with it right now!

I've been a software engineer for 3 years now, graduated from FEUP in '14, with a knack and passion for development, system analysis, automation but mostly quirky retorts. I've dabbled in AR/VR, mobile, devops and product development, and you'll find me either drifting through the tubes online, poking around and looking for leaks, or just passed out on the nearest couch!
