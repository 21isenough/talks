Description
-----------

Our goal with Sentiment Analytics was to be able to extract more value from social media - starting with the Siemens Social Network (SSN). We wanted to understand how collaborators felt about our internal topics.

Using Business Intelligence Tools, SAP HANA and Qlikview, will help us identify positive, negative and neutral texts, extracting automatically sentiments with a unique combination of statistical modeling and rule-based natural language processing techniques.
