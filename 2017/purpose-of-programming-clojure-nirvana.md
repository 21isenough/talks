Description
-----------

Every software engineer’s job is to do data processing. That might seem a bold statement but if you look at every single program you build they end up transforming data in a way or another. A typical example could be an http request being transformed by some logic and ending up as a record in a database. 

If all we do is data processing why aren’t our programs designed that way? 
Why don’t we just focus on data and the transformations we want to do with it?
Why do we need to replicate the world by building hierarchies of classes, factories?
Does OO makes sense today for building data intensive applications?

As a data engineer, part of my job is to find the best ways to transform and work with data. During this path, I’ve come across with Clojure. Clojure opened my mind in the way I approach the development of software and it made me question many of my dogmas (e.g. Object Oriented Programming). My purpose for this talk is to share those findings with you. These include (but are not limited to):

- software programs can be modeled as transducers;
- the implicit context and complexity of object orientation;
- mutation of state, the root of all evil;
- functional programming boosts productivity and confidence
- Clojure opens the mind to new ways of testing
- functional programs are a lot easier to scale and the industry is moving in that direction (e.g just take a look into Java 8 and 9)

I dare you to show up.
