Low Power Radio WAN: LoRa and Sigfox
===================================

* Speaker : [José Gabriel Marcelino](https://pixels.camp/jmarcelino)
* Language : *English*
* Type: Workshop

Description
-----------

Learn how low cost, low power but long range radio technologies are linking the Internet of Things. We’ll start with a quick introduction on LoRa, Sigfox and NB-IoT and how to use these radio protocols - along with MQTT - to connect sensors to the web and beyond. 

Get hands-on experience using MicroPython to easily develop embedded applications using these radio technologies on the LoPy and SiPy boards from Pycom (kits will be provided for the workshop*)

By the end of the 1 hour workshop you will have your kit sending sensor or button data to the cloud server of your choice over low power radio - guaranteed or your money back! ;)

(You will need to bring your laptop to the workshop to be able to program the Pycom kits)

Jose runs Metavurt, an IoT design consultancy in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK which he founded in 2013. Coming from a software background his hardware ‘spark' came from experimenting with inexpensive micro controllers connected to smartphones using Bluetooth LE in the early days of this technology. Since then he has worked with several BLE projects - for example the LightBlue Bean kickstarter - and now is developing LoRa and Sigfox devices for clients across the UK.

When not working on new designs he loves helping others use these technologies either in the Things Network forum, in the Pycom forums where he’s a moderator or as a Sigfox Ambassador.
