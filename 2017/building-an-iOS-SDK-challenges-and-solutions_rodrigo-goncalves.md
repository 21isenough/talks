Description
-----------

The mission was to develop an iOS SDK for a fast growing company aiming to set the standard in its industry. 

The questions were many.

 * You have the engineering: how to design stable and powerful APIs? Which best practices should we stick to?
 * You have two languages to choose from: should we do it in Swift or Objective-C?
 * You have the end-users: Which pains will they feel? Can we make an easy integration? What about documentation? They will have issues, how to support them?
 * You have the platform: can we avoid long AppStore review cycles? UI customization should be possible.
 * And you have Product: which is the design that offers more flexibility for new features to other platforms?

The answers were found along the way, and we want to share them with the community at Pixels Camp!
