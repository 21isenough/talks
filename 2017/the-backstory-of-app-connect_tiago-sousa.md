The backstory on AppConnect
===========================

*Speaker* : Tiago Sousa
*Length* : 45 mins
*Language* : English

Description
-----------

Last April, Talkdesk unveiled a new marketplace for applications built on top of Talkdesk's data and core platform: https://developers.talkdesk.com

The goal of this talk is to go through the untold story of engineering challenges and the evolution of an idea for a platform; through a series of challenges, trade-offs and binding decisions, an engineering team worked towards a common goal: build a stable foundation where others can be productive and create value.

It will focus on the following:

1. Initial architectural goals: disentangle responsabilities from a monolith while empowering a crescendo of internal teams and why this matters.
2. First iterations: achieved goals vs missing promises, let's talk about both.
3. A public API: the idea of an MVP we can stand for.
4. Working as a team: how to deliver value for multiple stakeholders on a tight deadline, collaborate and work effectively as a team.
