Genuinely curious, I studied Humanities before becoming passionate by computer programming.

Web developer specialized in Javascript/Typescript, I am practicing functional programming with the React/Redux stack. 

Fascinated by the discovery of Bitcoin, I have dedicate myself to blockchain technology, decentralized nets, crypto-anarchy, crypto-currencies, cyber-security, etc. 

I have founded D10e Consulting in order to propose the development of decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform as well as technical trainings.
