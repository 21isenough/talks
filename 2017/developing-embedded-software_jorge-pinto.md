Description
-----------

Since some years, I am being developing OpenSource firmware for the chinese electric motor controllers that are used on small electric vehicules: hoverboards, skates, unicycles and bicycles.

This chinese controllers are dirty cheap, capable and with ok quality. Since they optimize their products for price, they have very limited resources - developing firmware for their controllers means learning how to make "the thing" in a unique and creative ways, optimizing all the processing power and memory used.

Why I decided strategically to develop firmware for the cheap chinese controllers? Because the market is flooded with them: they work well and are easy to get. This OpenSource firmware is the first in the world and I hope it will be used by many users as possible, shapping the future like Arduino did.

I would like to present my experience, from developing the firmware and up to try gather a community and contact with people all over the world (using a lot Google translator for german, chinese, etc).

I am awesome because I put my energies to develop tecnhologies that will help "to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market _small electric vehicules_ to market as soon as possible." -- almost like Tesla :-)

Since some years, I am being developing OpenSource knowledge and technology for electric vehicules: motors, motor controllers and battery controllers. I believe this is my contribuiton for a better world.
