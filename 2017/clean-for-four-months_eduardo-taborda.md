Description
-----------

It is possible to me to talk about [The Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), because of our team effort to built proof of concepts, one for Android and other for iOS.

The title is as metaphor for the effort we developers make to (```keep```) write [Clean Code](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Martin-Clean-Code-A-Handbook-of-Agile-Software-Craftsmanship/PGM63937.html) as in the book.

It ```Starks``` from a interpretation of what is ```Clean``` and ends with the outcomes of a (```four months```) proof of concept for the Android platform.

* What I as running away from, when a stumble over Clean.
* A glimpse of what is Clean. (To a full understanding [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin) is the best).
* How implementing Clean can be exciting for developers, and at the same time ensures a long life to the project.

People started giving me money to build software since 1999, and that is what a really like to do.

Even during college, my preferred classes were the ones that put us in front of the computer to build stuff.

The Android come into my life in 2009 with ```SAPO Noticias```, and I've been working on Android until today, and ```believe me``` its still challenging.

Currently I am working in OLX, helping improve our software quality.
