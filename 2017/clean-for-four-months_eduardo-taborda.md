People started giving me money to build software since 1999, and that is
what a really like to do.

Even during college, my preferred classes were the ones that put us in
front of the computer to build stuff.

The Android come into my life in 2009 with ```SAPO Noticias```, and
I've been working on Android until today, and ```believe me``` its
still challenging.
