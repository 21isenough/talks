Description
-----------

Is Continuous Deployment familiar to you? Have you struggled with automated deploys?

Packer is a powerful tool to create machine images in parallel for multiple platforms. It takes advantage of the power of configuration management tools like Ansible to provision those machines and to produce Immutable Servers that simplify the building and deployment processes of continuous deployment.

To show how these tools can be put together, over the course of the presentation I will explain how Packer works and how to create the configuration file that will be used to bake the machine images, we will then see how we can provision those machines using Ansible to install the necessary software to run your applications.
