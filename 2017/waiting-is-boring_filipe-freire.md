Waiting is boring
========================

Description
-----------

Waiting. Nobody likes it.

Picture this: you make tests in a continuous integration workplace. Be it webpages, microservices, topologies, messaging systems.

Somewhere along the way you've gone to the dark side. You have to make the computer wait or sleep because something is not ready.

Forget about standard "waiting". There are new techniques that are not known by many, but that make waiting in tests smarter. Some of these techniques will be live demonstrated for a typical frontend application test and micro-service with an API and messaging.

I'm Filipe and I'm a Test Engineer and a Developer.

Currently I work at Blip in Porto as a Test Automation Engineer.

In my professional life I've had to wait in a lot of different ways. Be it for elements in webpages and messages sitting in queues. So I've come to develop an itch to make tests run smarter, faster and sleep a lot less. No coffee added to the equation.
