Operations as a Product
========================

* Speaker   : *Pedro Coelho*
* Length    : *45-60 minutes*
* Language  : *English*

Description
-----------

Software products are becoming more complex, and their ability to change and rapidly adapt quickly became the staple of successful companies. As such, engineering teams are becoming increasingly demanding, and infrastructure more diversified everyday: not only you have to deal with customer facing production, but with development environments, a bunch of test environments for new experiments, data pipelines, build pipelines, deployment pipelines, complex topologies using distributed systems and micro services and so on. All of this results in endless requests that quickly overthrows the more traditional service desk approach to operations, as the team is flooded with an insane amount of work ultimately becoming a bottleneck to other teams and the company itself.

This talk will explore a product approach to operations, where Ops proactively provide engineering teams their services abstracted in APIs or tools. It will expose some methodologies that may be used to ease things up, and what tools the ecosystem provides these days to support rapid development in the Ops team. It will also look at some product design techniques to detect our usersâ€™ needs and alert on some common pitfalls, and look at how some companies were successful in monetising this approach to create new public products.
