Description
-----------

Containers are all the rage and everyone says you need to be using them, meanwhile your Ansible playbooks are more than enough. And you got VM’s to isolate your workflows, why the hell do you need to containerize? I’ll try to show you that kubernetes offers a lot you might be implementing yourself, and why you should consider giving it a try.

Still, you look up the documentation, and there’s a million things going on. How does it actually work and what can you easily do with it? We’re going to go over some example deployments that show you how you can get from a simple stateless application, up to a stateful data store distributed across availability zones. Throughout, we’ll go over cool tricks, things to keep in mind, kubernetes internals and fearless live demos.
