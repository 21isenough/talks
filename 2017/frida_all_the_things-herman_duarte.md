====================

* Speaker   : [Herman Duarte](https://pixels.camp/hduarte)
* Length    : *45 mins*
* Language  : *English*

Description
-----------

Frida is an awesome RE tool that allows one to be inside the blackbox with a front row view of the show. It works in iOS, Android, Mac OS, Windows, Linux and QNX. So basically almost everywhere. In this talk will go from zero to hero, from knowing nothing about frida into having it working for us and enabling us to reverse engineer an iOS application with ease. I'll be talking also a little bit of how things work under the hood in frida. If you like RE and dynamic analysis, if you're a pentester, or if you're into security and love low level stuff this talk is definitely for you.
