Launchpad Finals
==========================

* Length: 3 hours
* Language: English

Description
-----------

The potential of recent technological advancements is yet to be fully realized by large corporations.

Our aim with Launchpad is to foster the adoption of promising technologies among corporations and help develop new companies.

It consists in presenting an idea, a fully developed product, or something in between, in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Augmented/Virtual Reality and Cybersecurity, as applied to five key sectors: Retail, Telco, Financial Services, Healthcare, and Energy.

Selected candidates will present their solution to a panel of decision-makers from leading enterprises during the finals at Pixels Camp.

Winning teams will be offered cash prizes along with the opportunity to further develop their solution in close proximity to the industry and their target clients. Bright Pixel will help teams during a six-month program including tech support, business mentoring, networking with partners and clients, and links to both the portuguese and international entrepreneurial ecosystem.
