Description
-----------

The advent of augmented, virtual and mixed reality has created a new demand for 3D applications and visualizations.  Once the domain of games and entertainment, now productivity is driving the new wave for MR experiences.  We are at a crossroads where users live in a mobile, wireless and on-demand world but high-end 3D applications are stuck tethered to large desktops and wired headsets.

The 3D Streaming Toolkit was started to provide a solution to this problem.  Using the toolkit, you can deliver an uncompromised experience to your users on any mobile platform or device. The purpose is to provide an open toolkit to enable industries to leverage remote cloud rendering in their service and product pipelines. This is required for many industries where the scale and complexity of 3D models, scenes, physics and rendering is beyond the capabilities of a mobile device platform. We are extending the industry standard WebRTC framework to 3D scenarios including mixed reality and will walk through the work we are doing to realize the goal of delivering high-quality 3D applications to any client - web, mobile, desktop and embedded.
