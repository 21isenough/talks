A Pinch of Functional on the Client's Plate
========================

* Speaker   : [Sasha Fonseca](https://pixels.camp/sashaafm)
* Length    : 25-30 min.
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

Functional programming alongside lambda calculus, immutability, and static type checking are all
hot topics which appear on many software development circles. The rising trend of such a paradigm for
backend development has leaked into the frontend and has made several languages based on it emerge.

The Elm programming language is part of this new set of languages aimed for the presentation layer.
Elm - based on Haskell - makes use of these ideas in order to equip the programmer with
extraordinary development powers. The language compiles to Javascript and aims to offer zero
runtime exceptions, great performance due to its own Virtual DOM implementation, and extreme
confidence in refactorings.

As someone who has a lot of interest in functional programming and never got around to learning
frontend development, I decided to go with Elm as a first experience. Therefore, in this talk
I'll present the language from the viewpoint of someone experienced in this paradigm but also
as a beginner to the client side of things.

Sasha Fonseca is a Software Engineer @ Talkdesk, but a curious learner at heart. He is always 
exploring his main interests (Programming Languages, and Software Development methodologies and
practices), but also trying to get his feet wet in other ones. Since late 2015 he has been the 
organizer of the Lisbon |> Elixir meetup, his main language of choice.
