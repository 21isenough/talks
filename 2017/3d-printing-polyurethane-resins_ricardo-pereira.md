3D printing and polyurethane resins for rapid iteration of functional prototypes
==========================

* Speaker   : [Ricardo Pereira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardopereiradesigner/) and [Michael Memeteau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmemetea/)
* Length: 60min
* Language: English
* Type: Workshop

Description
-----------

Participants will learn how to take advantage of two manufacturing techniques (digital, other more traditional) to manufacture working prototypes at low cost with features that would not be easily achievable otherwise.

Contrary to what happens with the manufacture of a mold (even low cost), there is here the possibility of modifying the production drawing between each iteration.

This is a hands on activity.

We will provide printed blueprint 3D and polyurethane resins to the participants.

Laptops not required.

Born in 1982 in Porto, Ricardo graduated in Industrial Design in 2007 in Lus√≠ada College from the Porto University. During graduation he worked teaching multimedia software in a private School. After graduation, he worked as rendering freelancer for the construction sector and was admitted in the Institute of Mechanical Engineering INEGI as responsible for producing rigid and flexible molds and prototypes. Throughout this three year period he developed expertise in shaping medical prosthetics and tools for the medical industry, and in the investment casting tools to materialize the models in titanium alloys. In 2011 he co-founded Kohta Creative Studio.
