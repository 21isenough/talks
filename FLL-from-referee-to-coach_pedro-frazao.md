Description
-----------

FIRST LEGO Leage (FLL) It's a amazing way to learn, not only technology or engineering or math, but much more. It's a good way to engage children in the learning process.
In the presentation I'll share my experience as a FLL referee and as a coach of a small team.

Speaker Bio
-----------

I've been working in telecommunication since 1997 (at EUnet). In this
path I worked as: system administrator (mainly Linux); services
administrator (DNS; HTTP; FTP; IRC; etc); networker (OSPF; BGP; etc)
and as developer of NMS. As developed I designed and developed, some
times with a couple of other developers, systems to: make massive SNMP
collection and store; process and summarize RTP packages from video
service; perdition service of IPTV service quality on a DSL network,
based on geographic referenced data; webservices for provisioning and
troubleshooting for technologies like DSL and GPON using SNMP, TL1 and
CLI interfaces. Almost all systems developed with Perl and using
technologies as: Linux; MySQL and Redis.
