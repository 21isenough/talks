The answer to this question is simple: diverse teams are more effective teams. Teams with gender diversity have been proven to be more creative, productive and innovative. Yet, the number of women pursuing a career path in technological industries is significantly lower than men and, as if that were not enough, it is estimated that half the women who enter the technology field leave over time. What are the reasons behind this gender­gap? What can we do to reverse this? 

Around the world, several programs emerged focused on women. Programs, such as Rails Girls, Rails Girls Summer of Code, Women in Tech, Women Techmakers and Lean In, aim to invigorate the women working in tech and amplify their voices. But is that enough?

The diversity problem affects us all, men and women, from all colours, races and religions. And each of us holds the power to make a difference. By breaking the current stereotypes and by providing new role models, each and every one of us can help to make a difference.

My biggest achievement, so far, was [being retweeted by Carrie Fisher] (https://twitter.com/ines_opcoelho/status/681725407591284736). By the way, Han shot first. And Firefly should be watched in the correct order.
