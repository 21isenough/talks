Description
-----------

We are all on the business of distributed computing no matter if you are a back-end or a front-end developer, and this is a hard problem to solve.

This talk is about  how we can use a LISP in this case Clojure/ClojureScript to address our web development problems and avoid some icendital complexity.

# WTF

Clojure is a Lisp for the JVM oriented around doing multi-core  and concurrent programming, and is doing pretty well for the nitch that it fits, but the JVM doesn't run everywhere, I remember back in early days when SUN talked about Java there was this fantasy that Java will run the server and in the client solving all this internet problems, it kinda didn't work that way.

Javascript.... javascript is really the language of clients, some even call it the assembly language of the web, it is everywhere and everything compiles into javascript this days, so do also ClojureScript a Lisp that compiles to Javascript bringging all Clojure toolset and simplicity to the client-side world.

# The plan

I attended to codebits 2008 and saw Mario Valente's proposal to use javascript everywhere and conquer the world by 2015. In 2016 I'll try to do the same but this time with one of the most old, powerful and misunderstood languages of all time, I'll like to call it `the revenge of LISP`.

We will dig into what it brings into the table and how we can use this language and all the toolset to approach our day to day web development problems.

The idea is to have 15 mins where I'll sell and talk about why this is a kickass stack aka flamewar!, 15mins showing some code and demos aka fail bad, 10 mins for questions aka you guys trying to refute me :)

So bring your laptops and don't be afraid of some (parenthesis (ftw!))
