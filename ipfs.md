Description
-----------

The Web, the platform that we love and learned to rely on, has converged to a centralised, failure prone, exclusive and censured platform. However, the Internet, the underlying network that connects every device together, is not the fault for how the Web platform has turned. 

We need to bring the distributed properties of the Internet back! That is why we, the IPFS community, are building the InterPlanetary Filesystem, a mountable and distributed file storage protocol that provides cryptographic versioning (never move the same piece of content twice), free deduplication (avoid hitting the server several times for the same data) and distributed discovery (make Web Apps work ‘offline’!). 

This talk will go through the design of IPFS and how we can build fully decentralised Web Applications using Web technologies, today!
