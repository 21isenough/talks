Description

Minecraft is a game developed by Markus Persson (or "Notch") and it's a voxel's sandbox. When I first saw the game, I thought that this was a good thing for kids to play and increase the barriers of their own imagination. It was a very different game and it open doors for a bunch of things. Small computers with some kb of RAM, data storage, logic and arithmetics. But, after some time, I saw that this was just a part of it: there was a programming part.

Some years pass (and I was in my second year on College) and I decided to enter in the world of minecraft, but this time, in the programming part. For those who only heard about the construction part, imagine that you can put whatever you want inside the game. Another door opened.

After some tryes, I realize that I was learning Java in a different way that I learned in College. Inheritance, (abstract) Classes, API's, etc. The way that I learned Java with this was very different from the normal classes that I had, it was very different and, nowadays, games can teach us not only to think, but also how to program. Minecraft was not the pionner on this, but it helped. And export this way of learning to the College could help to new future Engineers learn new languages.
