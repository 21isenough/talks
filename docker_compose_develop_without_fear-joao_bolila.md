Description
-----------

In this talk I'll guide the build of a development environment for an application with separate
containers, connected towards a reproducible end trusted environment from development to production.

For this I'll be using a web application with three containers, a frontend running Nginx,
a Swagger API on NodeJS and a database (PostgreSQL or ElasticSearch).

Let's improve our relation with devOps team for good!
