Description
-----------

Being a solid SW Engineer is much more than just writing good code, knowing the latest languages or be aware of the hottest trends. Your career goals and the companies you work for also shape your future as they define much of the path you'll thread. There's always something to be learned with everyone that crosses your path with or in your current role. Sometimes these lessons aren't easy on us or the ones we'd like to learn but there's certainly virtue in accepting with grace and gratitude.

Extra Information
-----------------

In this talk I intend to cover other aspects that make a solid Engineer beside the ability to write to code. These include how you communicate, how you empathise, how you understand business decisions, how you ask the right questions and your attitude. I believe in a holistic view of the Software Engineer that is able to face the challenges of career and workability by using his/her entire potential of being a Human Being. Throughout the talk I'll discuss some hard challenges I was faced with during my working experience, tell about how sometimes I thought I had "screwed up big time" only to be able to "connect the dots" some years later. I'll also be sharing some approaches I took to improve myself as an Engineer and how all my tenures in "sometimes-not-so-glamorous" companies help me strengthening my wholeness as an Engineer. Disclaimer: no Human Beings or Companies will be harmed during my presentation.
