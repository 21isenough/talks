Description
-----------
> An engineer starts playing a new game... and then... birds chirping!

 That's what happens with [Factorio](http://factorio.com). It is **the game** for all those code makers. Automate all you can!

Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorio#Plot):
> The game follows the story of a spaceman who crash landed on an alien planet. As the only survivor, he has to harvest his resources by hand in order to build up an industrial infrastructure to eventually build a rocket and send a satellite to space, while facing inhabitants of the planet who defend their native environment from the pollution and destruction by the player.

Some words sound familiar!? That's right!

This talk will cover how you can deploy a Factorio server to AWS in an affordable and yet scalable way (so you can play long nights with as many friends as you want).

It will explore common *Infrastructure as Code* tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com), [Packer](https://www.packer.io), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) as well as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) specific products like [EC2 Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/).

Most importantly, it'll show how all of them fit together.

Bonus: code will be open source for you to play with!
