Description
-----------

Apple encourages every programmer to follow MVC pattern. When you do so, it's easy to end up with ViewController with more than 2000 lines, a lot of coupled and non-reusable code and also a lot of bugs. But:

* Is this best pattern that you should follow in your IOS applications?  
* Can you properly test an application that follows MVC?  
* Do you use dependency injection? What are the benefits of using it?  

In this presentation I will talk about the advantages of moving from MVC to MVVM pattern. I will compare both architectures and show how you can improve your code doing it, showing some  practical examples.

I will also talk about how you can improve your core using Reactive Programming and dependency injection.
