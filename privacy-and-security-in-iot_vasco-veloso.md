Description
-----------

We will go through an overview of security and privacy challenges that must be faced and solved when
creating new Things for the Internet of Things. We will discuss why are Things inherently insecure 
together with examples of attack vectors and learn some risk mitigation strategies. We will realize 
why should users be wary of Things violating their privacy and will gain awareness of upcoming EU 
privacy legislation that affects providers of IoT-based solutions. 

Speaker Bio
-----------

After 20+ years writing software, I'm currently working at Coriant Portugal as a Software Architect who still 
keeps his hands dirty designing and writing Java code for a distributed optical network management system. 

Curious about hardware design, the IoT and how it will affect how we go about our everyday lives. I built and
programmed embedded systems for a living for some time last century, which got me started on IoT this century.

Interested in design methodologies and distributed systems.
