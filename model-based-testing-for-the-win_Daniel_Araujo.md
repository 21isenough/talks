Description
-----------

Specifying black box tests to a system, in particular ensuring the correctness of its behaviour, can be a problematic task.

Apart from the usual tradeoff on the depth of test process versus economic factors, there are several issues that can be easily
spotted with the traditional approaches. Lack of coverage, small subset of the possible system inputs (that may cause internal state changes), error proneness, maintenance costs and lack of visibility are some of the known pitfalls.

In this 30 minutes talk, I am going to present an approach to black box testing, in terms of a generic methodology (model based, platform-agnostic) that can be adopted in (almost) any project. I will show you how this methodology can beat the rest of the commonly used approaches, by presenting a set of real world scenarios and addressing the common pitfalls.

Further from a conceptual overview this 30 minute talk will include real examples (including UI testing examples and model-based testing of non-functional requirements).


Speaker Bio
-----------

I am very curious programmer. After studying software engineering , data warehousing solutions, artificial intelligence, among other topics, I started my journey on the tech industry. Since then I had the opportunity to work with lots of inspiring people and deal with challenges that made me able to learn a bit from other computer sci fields. Mobile, search engines, betting sites are some of the domains on which I have been doing a bunch of things (front-end, back-end, operations, …). 

Currently my focus is on large scale systems that deal with enormous quantities of data.
