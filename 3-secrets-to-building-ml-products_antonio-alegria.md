Description
-----------

How to build Machine Learning products that scale and autonomously evolve using opensource technologies like Spark, Cassandra, Hadoop and many others.
 
While data technologies have been exploding and becoming commoditized, using them effectively to build a product that delivers real value to users can be a mysterious art. A lot of companies still use "gather data, think about it later" but then fail to put that data to work.
 
Let’s demystify machine learning system’s Data Science lifecycle (from data to production to a continuously evolvable system). Explore the fundamental recipe to build data-learning products that put data to work and provide experiences that are, ironically, more human.

I'm currently battling evildoers as the Product Lead at Feedzai, the fastest-growing startup in Portugal. I lead the development of our cloud-based, ecommerce fraud prevention service. As a software engineer with over 7 years of experience, I love designing and building systems that make sense of data, turning them into actionable insights for people and businesses.
