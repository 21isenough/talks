Description
-----------

I'm proposing something a little different. Should you choose to accept this mission, I'll be live coding some shader code (GLSL) to the sound of something, [inspired by revision's shader battles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-1zEo7DD8w). I'll be open to suggestions, and I'll try to explain how distance field rendering works in the process.

Speaker Bio

Man enough to try it.
